Throughout the course of the game the player must battle the <a href=\"\/xen\/3035-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-75\">Xen<\/a> invaders, soldiers and an elite Black Ops detachment in an effort to thwart the <a href=\"\/alien-invasion\/3015-408\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-408\">invasion<\/a>. Freeman is a <a href=\"\/silent-protagonist\/3015-54\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-54\">silent protagonist<\/a>, who has never had a single line of dialogue in the course of the franchise, but he remains a deep source of intrigue and discussion due to information learned throughout the course of the series.<\/p><p>Half-Life spawned two expansion packs named <a href=\"\/half-life-opposing-force\/3030-16508\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16508\">Half-Life: Opposing Force<\/a> and <a href=\"\/half-life-blue-shift\/3030-7814\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7814\">Half-Life: Blue Shift<\/a>. Half-Life was originally released for <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a> but was later ported to the <a href=\"\/playstation-2\/3045-19\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PS2<\/a> and included a <a href=\"\/cooperative-play\/3015-108\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">co-op mode<\/a> known as <a href=\"\/half-life-decay\/3030-22690\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22690\">Half-Life Decay<\/a>. A <a href=\"\/dreamcast\/3045-37\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-37\">Dreamcast<\/a> version was being worked on but was canceled before it could be released. Similarly, a <a href=\"\/mac\/3045-17\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Mac<\/a> port (outsourced to <a href=\"\/logicware-inc\/3010-784\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-784\">Logicware<\/a>) was canceled by Valve to avoid treating Mac users like \"second class citizens\".<\/p><p>Valve released an updated version of the original game, Half-Life: Source, which makes use of the <a href=\"\/source-engine\/3015-751\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-751\">Source Engine<\/a> to provide new water and physics effects, but did not feature a complete revamp of the game's assets.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Half-Life did little new in terms of control improvements at the time, but there were still many aspects of the genre that it revolutionized at the time of its release. The largest of these advancements was the lack of <a href=\"\/cutscene\/3015-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cut scenes<\/a>. The story was told through <a href=\"\/scripted-events\/3015-2039\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2039\">scripted sequences<\/a> that took place in real-time, in the same environment as the player. This lead to an incredibly immersive experience that players at the time had never seen before. Another important advancement in the genre was the lack of specified stages.<\/p><p>In a sense the whole game was just one big world, not split up into levels. Load times were short and were placed between certain doors or passageways. This little detail allowed the player to feel immersed in the story and the universe, and since the game took place in essentially one location, it made sense that each area was connected to the next.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1556490-gordonhl1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1556490\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1556490-gordonhl1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1556490\"><img alt=\"The game's protagonist, Gordon Freeman.\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1556490-gordonhl1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62890\/1556490-gordonhl1.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"><\/a><figcaption>The game's protagonist, Gordon Freeman.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>At the beginning of the game Gordon Freeman, the protagonist, is on his way to work at the <a href=\"\/black-mesa\/3035-64\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-64\">Black Mesa Research Facility<\/a>, presumably late, which is apparently commonplace for him. That day he is required to participate in a special experiment in the Anomalous Materials Lab in Sector C, where he is to push a <a href=\"\/crystal\/3055-445\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-445\">crystal<\/a> into the beam of the Anti-Mass Spectrometer in order to study it. Instantly, this causes a <a href=\"\/resonance-cascade\/3015-66\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-66\">resonance cascade<\/a>, where a <a href=\"\/portals\/3015-467\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-467\">portal<\/a> erupts between <a href=\"\/earth\/3035-65\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-65\">Earth<\/a> and a world known as <a href=\"\/xen\/3035-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-75\">Xen<\/a>.<\/p><p>Freeman reawakens, partially clueless as to what has just happened. Backtracking through the facility, he meets some scientists who brief him on what is happening. According to them contact with the surface is fragmented, although a rescue team is said to be arriving shortly. This later turns out to be the HECU, or the <a href=\"\/hecu\/3015-5715\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5715\">Hazardous Environment Combat Unit<\/a>, who infiltrate Black Mesa not to rescue but rather to kill everyone involved with the project. Freeman then begins his long journey through the facility, hoping to reach the surface. Along the way, it turns out that the facility has become a war zone between the <a href=\"\/military\/3015-1009\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1009\">military<\/a> and the Xen aliens. Freeman eventually learns about the Lambda Team -- who believe they have what it takes to reverse all this terror.<\/p><p>Along the way Gordon must launch a rocket satellite, with the intent of reversing the resonance cascade, by making his way through the underground, along a rail complex, to the satellite launch location. Gordon then redirects his path back to the Lambda Complex. At this time, the HECU begins to evacuate the facility, and commence air strikes. After that, Gordon no longer encounters military.<\/p><p>Finally, Gordon reaches the Lambda Complex. He has never been to this part of the facility, but learns a lot about the complex. This is where the technology to <a href=\"\/teleportation\/3015-8\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8\">teleport<\/a> to Xen was invented, and hopefully where the effects can be reversed. Though, Gordon learns from the few surviving scientists that the rocket satellite he has launched failed, and the only way left in order to reverse the effects is to go to Xen itself and kill the mysterious figurehead alien, <a href=\"\/the-nihilanth\/3005-648\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-648\">Nihilanth<\/a>. Gordon manages to get to Xen, and after a brief exploration through the planet, Gordon encounters the Nilhilanth. After destroying Nihilanth, Gordon is confronted by the mysterious <a href=\"\/g-man\/3005-421\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-421\">G-Man<\/a>.<\/p><p>G-Man can be spotted throughout the game, only briefly, to disappear around a corner and not be seen again. G-Man explains the situation through his fragmented English, stating his employers are interested in him, and that he believes Gordon has limitless potential. He then offers Gordon a job, which he may either reject or accept. If the player accepts, the G-Man is content with his decision, and makes it clear that this will <a href=\"\/cliffhanger\/3015-1010\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1010\">not be the last time<\/a> he will see him. If the player rejects, he is teleported unarmed to an area representing a place from Xen, surrounded by several Xen Grunts.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><p>Half-Life features a host of both traditional and non-traditional weapons. The primary weapons that can be found throughout the game are as follows:<\/p><h3>Crowbar<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440345-crowbar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440345\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440345-crowbar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440345\"><img alt=\"The famous crowbar.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1317\/440345-crowbar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440345-crowbar.jpg 640w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/1317\/440345-crowbar.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1317\/440345-crowbar.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The famous crowbar.\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1317\/440345-crowbar.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440345-crowbar.jpg 640w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/1317\/440345-crowbar.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1317\/440345-crowbar.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The famous crowbar.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>This melee weapon has inexplicably become synonymous with the <a href=\"\/half-life\/3025-293\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-293\">Half-Life franchise<\/a>. As a melee weapon, once guns are obtained it should really only be used as a weapon of last resort, and to save ammo when busting open crates and boxes.<\/p><h3>Pistol<\/h3><p>A basic handgun that can be found in many first-person shooters. The pistol in Half-Life is modeled after a Glock 17, and is replaced by a Beretta 92FS is the graphical overhaul that came with Blue Shift. The weapon isn\u2019t too powerful, although headshots will quickly down enemies. If, however, the player uses the alternative fire method, then the 9mm fires a quick burst of rounds at the expense of range and accuracy.<\/p><h3>Magnum Revolver<\/h3><p>A <a href=\"\/revolver\/3055-1021\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1021\">revolver<\/a> that packs quite a punch. While it can only fire single shots, the magnum has a <a href=\"\/scope\/3055-738\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-738\">zoom<\/a> feature that can be accessed by pressing the alternative fire key. Using this zoom feature, the magnum becomes a medium to long range weapon and is far more effective then the 9mm at range. The revolver is modeled after a Colt Python .357 Magnum.<\/p><h3>Shotgun<\/h3><p>A weapon familiar to all first person shooter fans, the <a href=\"\/shotgun\/3055-114\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\">shotgun<\/a> is easily one of the most powerful close range weapons in the game. Using its alternate fire discharges two shells instead of one, doubling the damage potential but increasing the time between shots. The shotgun is modeled after a Franchi SPAS-12.<\/p><h3>SMG<\/h3><p>A <a href=\"\/submachine-gun\/3055-766\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-766\">submachine gun<\/a> with an attached <a href=\"\/grenade-launcher\/3055-252\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-252\">grenade launcher<\/a>, a versatile weapon. The MP5 is a rapid fire submachine gun which is great at short to medium ranges. Its alternate fire, a built in grenade launcher, can be devastating, though ammo is limited and the player will be <a href=\"\/splash-damage\/3015-347\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-347\">injured by it<\/a> if too close to the explosion. In the Blue Shift graphical revamp, the MP5 was replaced by an M4 Carbine.<\/p><h3>Rocket Launcher<\/h3><p>This <a href=\"\/rocket-launcher\/3055-211\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\">rocket launcher<\/a> always hits its mark. The RPG in Half-life isn\u2019t radically different from other shooters, but the special thing about this weapon is that its laser guided. This means wherever the player points the laser the missile will hit, making it a great weapon that\u2019s also quite accurate, at the cost of making it impossible to \"fire and forget\", requiring the player to expose themselves to enemy fire until the missile hits its target. It does not feature an alternate fire.<\/p><h3>Crossbow<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440358-crossbow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440358\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440358-crossbow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440358\"><img alt=\"Half-Life's crossbow.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440358-crossbow.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440358-crossbow.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Half-Life's crossbow.\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440358-crossbow.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440358-crossbow.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Half-Life's crossbow.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The most accurate weapon in the game, the <a href=\"\/crossbow\/3055-107\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-107\">crossbow<\/a>, in its primary fire mode, fires explosive tipped bolts. The player can greatly increase the range of the <a href=\"\/crossbow\/3055-107\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-107\">crossbow<\/a> by using its scope<\/p><p>(accessed by pressing the alternative fire key again) and by doing this the crossbow virtually becomes a <a href=\"\/sniper-rifle\/3055-67\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\">sniper rifle<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Tau Cannon<\/h3><p>The Gauss Gun is an experimental and highly unstable weapon. One of the weapons most important abilities is that it can shoot through walls, meaning no one is safe from its sights. The player can charge the gun up by using the alternative fire key and by doing this the gun will fire a more powerful shot, rather then several weaker shots.<\/p><h3>Gluon Gun<\/h3><p>Also known as the \"Egon\", this weapon is a product of Black Mesa\u2019s Weapons Research Facility. The gun fires a constant <a href=\"\/laser\/3055-140\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-140\">stream of energy<\/a> which destroys most things in its path. The weapon's negative point is that shares its ammo with the Gauss Gun, and uses its ammunition very quickly if fired for too long.<\/p><h3>Hive-Hand<\/h3><p>An alien weapon that basically unleashes <a href=\"\/animal-weaponry\/3015-2027\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2027\">swarms of hornets<\/a> on the enemy. A good medium range weapon but weak in both long and close range. Its ammo regenerates after a few seconds, so it effectively has unlimited ammo.<\/p><h3>Snark<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440325-snark.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440325\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440325-snark.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-440325\"><img alt=\"A Snark.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440325-snark.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440325-snark.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Snark.\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440325-snark.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1317\/440325-snark.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A Snark.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>These little critters are tossed at the enemy much like a grenade. If there are no enemies nearby, the Snarks will turn on the player, often resulting in a gruesome death. After a period of time the Snarks explode, and while this is a weakness, they are a great weapon partially because they are so much fun.<\/p><h3>Fragmentation Grenades<\/h3><p>Basic frag grenades are included in Half-Life as well, and tend to be fairly run-of-the-mill. They have a five second fuse and possess no alternate fire, but can be \"cooked\" by holding down primary fire for a length of time before releasing. Be careful not to hold it for too long.<\/p><h3>Satchel Charges<\/h3><p>Satchels are essentially remote-activate explosives, which are set by using the primary or alternate fire initially. The player can either choose to detonate the placed satchel, or place additional satchels. Detonating after placing multiple satchels will destory them all at once.<\/p><h3>Laser Tripmines<\/h3><p>These <a href=\"\/trip-mine\/3055-541\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-541\">mines<\/a> are attached to walls and, after three seconds, project a laser beam that causes the mine to detonate when the beam is broken, either by the player or an enemy. These mines can also destroyed if shot at directly, and are frequently used both online and off to block off paths and restrict player movement.<\/p><h3>High-Definition Pack and Weapons<\/h3><p>The High-Definition Pack changed several of the weapons in Half-Life, but the changes are mostly aesthetic improvements. However, a few weapons were actually changed into different guns, despite maintaining the same statistics; The MP5 was replaced with an <a href=\"\/m4-carbine\/3055-622\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-622\">M4 Carbine<\/a> with an attached M203, the Glock 9mm Pistol was replaced with a <a href=\"\/m9-pistol\/3055-940\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-940\">Beretta 92F<\/a>, and modeled the shotgun more closely after a <a href=\"\/spas-12\/3055-1364\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1364\">SPAS-12<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Levels<\/h2><p>Half-Life doesn't have levels per se, at least not in the normal sense of the word; instead, the player is given an on-screen title whenever a new area loads-- very much like in an interactive book. This apparently simple idea helped the player getting even more immersed in the Half-Live universe and story. Here's a list of those titles:<\/p><ol><li><b>Anomalous Materials<\/b><\/li><li><b>Unforeseen Consequences<\/b><\/li><li><b>Office Complex<\/b><\/li><li><b>We've got Hostiles<\/b><\/li><li><b>Blast Pit<\/b><\/li><li><b>Power Up<\/b><\/li><li><b>On A Rail<\/b><\/li><li><b>Apprehension<\/b><\/li><li><b>Residue Processing<\/b><\/li><li><b>Questionable Ethics<\/b><\/li><li><b>Surface Tension<\/b><\/li><li><b>Forget About Freeman<\/b><\/li><li><b>Lambda Core<\/b><\/li><li><b>Xen<\/b><\/li><li><b>Gonarch's Lair<\/b><\/li><li><b>Interloper<\/b><\/li><li><b>Nihilanth<\/b><\/li><li><b>End Game<\/b><\/li><\/ol><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p>Half-Life shipped with a <a href=\"\/online\/3015-559\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">multiplayer<\/a> component that offered standard modes of play, including <a href=\"\/deathmatch\/3015-451\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-451\">deathmatch<\/a>.

The game has been received quite well with most critics agreeing that it is better than <a href=\"\/half-life-2-episode-one\/3030-14328\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14328\">Half-Life 2: Episode One<\/a>, and may even match the success of <a href=\"\/half-life-2\/3030-1539\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1539\">Half-Life 2<\/a>.<\/p><p>The game is linear in nature, with areas in the world that can be explored that are alongside the main path of the game. The game mostly takes place in forests or very small military outposts or civilian towns. It is split into multiple chapters that can be played individually once beaten at least once. The design is focused much on the characters and environment, thus most of what you can see in the world you can interact with by some means, usually with the <a href=\"\/\">Gravity Gun<\/a>. The characters are also quite detailed, mostly in the facial animations and body movement. From a gameplay perspective, the design is either usually centered on a puzzle that must be solved, through use of the <a href=\"\/\">Gravity Gun<\/a> or some trigger in the environment, or fire-fights between you and the AI.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13692\/1085313-ep2_outland_020003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1085313\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13692\/1085313-ep2_outland_020003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1085313\"><img alt=\"Vortigaunts are still present and are eager to help the player.\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/13692\/1085313-ep2_outland_020003.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13692\/1085313-ep2_outland_020003.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/13692\/1085313-ep2_outland_020003.jpg 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/13692\/1085313-ep2_outland_020003.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/a><figcaption>Vortigaunts are still present and are eager to help the player.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous entries in the series; this is a First Person Shooter, with much of the trappings of what you expect an FPS to have. Unlike most modern FPSs, the game includes many puzzle-based game mechanics while leaving out <a href=\"\/iron-sights\/3015-567\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-567\">iron sights<\/a>. The movement style also hearkens back to earlier eras. Whereas in more modern games movement is slower and feels heavier, HL2: Episode 2 maintains the fast paced movement style that is becoming less frequent. The one big game mechanic that has been a centerpiece since <a href=\"\/\">Half-Life 2<\/a>, the <a href=\"\/\">Gravity Gun<\/a>, is back, thus allowing you to manipulate the environment by picking up and throwing objects.<\/p><h3>New in Episode Two<\/h3><p>One significant change from past games is the inclusion of large vehicle sections. While <a href=\"\/\">Half-Life 2<\/a> also had vehicle sections, they felt more isolate and closed off from the rest of the game, being only seen in one level before moving on. In Episode 2, you gain a vehicle early on and traveling through most of the game with it. Throughout the game, there are areas that can be explored on the driving paths that are optional, but give rewards such as ammo and health.<\/p><p>Valve has said that each Episode (from 1-3) has been built around a specific design choice that would allow them to further experiment with their <a href=\"\/\">Source<\/a> engine and how they create games. With Episode 1 it was the inclusion of a highly sophisticated AI partner, <a href=\"\/\">Alyx Vance<\/a>, who accompanied you throughout most of the game. In Episode 2, the new game mechanic was that of augmenting Valves <a href=\"\/\">Source<\/a> engine to allow for much more open environments and larger scale battles, as illustrated by the final battle in the game and the many large open forest areas you encounter throughout the game.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><h3>To the White Forest<\/h3><p>Half Life 2: Episode Two starts hours after the events of Half Life 2: Episode 1. Gordon finds himself mildly injured and trapped inside the same train on which he and <a href=\"\/alyx-vance\/3005-640\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-640\">Alyx Vance<\/a> departed from <a href=\"\/city-17\/3035-63\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-63\">City 17<\/a> only <a href=\"\/half-life-2-episode-one\/3030-14328\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14328\">hours earlier<\/a>. After making his way to the front of the mangled train car, Alyx appears outside and is greatly relieved to find Gordon safe.

A nearby <a href=\"\/vortigaunt\/3015-221\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-221\">Vortigaunt<\/a> senses the trouble and comes just in time to save an unconscious Alyx from being finished off by an <a href=\"\/antlion\/3015-252\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-252\">Ant-Lion<\/a>. After assessing Alyx\u2019s wounds, the Vort tells Gordon that it will not be easy to save her and that they will require the Ant-Lion\u2019s larval extract, as it possesses powerful healing qualities. Gordon and the Vort travel deep into the Ant-Lions\u2019 hive and steal the larval extract. Meanwhile, other Vortigaunts are keeping Alyx\u2019s state stable back in an abandoned silo. Upon returning to Alyx with the extract, Gordon is told that the Vortigaunts must weave Gordon and Alyx's life forces, effectively intertwining their fates.<\/p><p>Just before Alyx\u2019s wounds are healed, the <a href=\"\/g-man\/3005-421\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-421\">G-Man<\/a> appears for the first time since the beginning of <a href=\"\/half-life-2-episode-one\/3030-14328\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14328\">Episode 1<\/a>. The G-man acknowledges that it is not a very good time for a \u201cheart to heart,\u201d but the <a href=\"\/vortigaunt\/3015-221\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-221\">Vortigaunts<\/a> had been preventing him from appearing to Gordon prior to that point. The G-Man explains that Alyx would not even be alive today had he not saved her from Black Mesa and, as a form of repayment for keeping her alive, he charges Gordon with the duty of safely delivering her to White Forest. The G-Man then plants a hypnotic suggestion in Alyx\u2019s mind instructing her to relay the message \u201cprepare for unforeseen consequences\u201d to her father.<\/p><p>After the G-Man\u2019s cryptic visit, Alyx awakens fully healed but still in pain. Gordon and a Vortigaunt companion assist her into an elevator and the trio sets off to find a car. Eventually, Alyx fully recovers and the group finds a car, giving Gordon and Alyx an opportunity to quickly head to White Forest. Gordon and Alyx encounter several obstacles on the way to White Forest, but after staving off several ambushes by Combine soldiers, hunters, and a Hunter Chopper, they finally make it to the base. There, they are warmly greeted by Eli and Dr. Kleiner. The reunion is cut short when a Combine raiding party breaches security and makes it into the base. Gordon eliminates the threat by defeating most of the enemies and sealing the silo doors to prevent further Combine invasion.<\/p><h3>Mutual Friend<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-293831\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-293831\"><img alt=\"Dr Kleiner and Eli Vance\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Dr Kleiner and Eli Vance\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/2433\/293831-ep2_outland_11b0085.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Dr Kleiner and Eli Vance<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After Gordon reunites with the group, they go to Eli\u2019s work area to watch a transmission from <a href=\"\/judith-mossman\/3005-1092\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1092\">Judith Mossman<\/a> that was recovered along with the data packet in Episode 1. Eli becomes incredibly nervous after seeing that Judith is in danger, and becomes even more rattled upon Dr. Kleiner\u2019s discovery of a hidden message in Judith\u2019s transmission. The message reveals that Judith has discovered The Borealis, a legendary research vessel that infamously disappeared years ago. It is learned that the vessel was owned by <a href=\"\/black-mesa\/3035-64\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-64\">Black Mesa<\/a> competitor, <a href=\"\/aperture-science-enrichment-center\/3035-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-94\">Aperture Science<\/a>. Kleiner and Eli have a heated debate about what should be done with the vessel. Eli is convinced that The Borealis can only bring more harm to earth and must be destroyed, while Kleiner urges that knowledge gained from The Borealis could help the humans finish off Combine forces on earth.<\/p><p>The argument is left unfinished, and Kleiner leaves to prepare for the firing of the rocket that is to be used to shut down the City 17 portal. Shortly after Kleiner has left, the G-Man triggers the hypnotic cue in Alyx\u2019s mind. Consequently, Alyx walks up to her father and says, \u201cDad, prepare for unforeseen consequences.\u201d Eli nearly collapses upon hearing this, and Alyx comes back out of her trance with no memory of what she just said. Eli assures her that he is alright and that he would just like a cup of tea. Alyx agrees to go make it, leaving Gordon and Eli alone in the work room.<\/p><p>With Alyx out of earshot, Eli confides in Gordon the importance of the line \u201cprepare for unforeseen consequences.\u201d According to Eli, that is exactly what the G-Man had told him just before the <a href=\"\/resonance-cascade\/3015-66\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-66\">resonance cascade<\/a> at <a href=\"\/black-mesa-research-facility\/3035-64\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-64\">Black Mesa<\/a> was triggered.

Everyone at the base agrees that Gordon should be the one who launches the rocket and so he presses the button launching the salvation of humanity into the super portal and destroying the last chance the Combine had at retaking Earth.<\/p><h3>Endgame<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223649\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223649\"><img alt=\"Striders and hunters attacking the base\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg 640w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Striders and hunters attacking the base\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg 640w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/729\/223649-0000002591_1024x768.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Striders and hunters attacking the base<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The game concludes with Alyx and Gordon preparing to take off in a helicopter that Alyx fixed up.

The Advisor slowly floats over to a knocked over Eli just as another Advisor enters and keeps Gordon and Alyx completely immobile. Eli tries fruitlessly to hurt the Advisor with a pipe but the Advisor shrugs it off and picks up Eli in his mechanical arms. Eli is turned towards Gordon and Alyx as he is raised up to the Advisors extending tongue, he tells Alyx to close her eyes as she screams in horror for her Father\u2019s life.

Along the way they see that the screens previously used by <a href=\"\/wallace-breen\/3005-1187\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1187\">Wallace Breen<\/a> as a means of propaganda have been taken over by Dr Isaac Kleiner, who is now urging all citizens to evacuate the city before the cataclysmic Citadel explosion. Gordon and Alyx meet up with their good friend <a href=\"\/barney-calhoun\/3005-642\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-642\">Barney Calhoun<\/a> who, along with other survivors, are planning to escape City 17 via train.

The second feature is the focus on physics-based combat. For the first half of the game, players either have no weapon besides the <a href=\"\/zero-point-energy-field-manipulator\/3055-20\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-20\">Gravity Gun<\/a>, or have very little ammo. Thus, use of the Gravity Gun becomes essential. The third feature is the advancement in <a href=\"\/alyx-vance\/3005-640\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-640\">Alyx's<\/a> AI. For example, if the player shines their flashlight into Alyx's eyes, she will squint and hold up her arm; in the middle of combat with a zombie, she may kick it's <a href=\"\/headcrab\/3015-230\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-230\">headcrab<\/a> off, or dodge its attacks.The third feature is the <a href=\"\/zombine\/3015-1624\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1624\">Zombine<\/a>, a new enemy. This Combine zombie is much faster than its regular counterpart (though it lacks the frightening alacrity of the fast zombie), and can take much more damage. The greatest danger it poses, however, is its tendency to pull out a live <a href=\"\/grenade\/3055-111\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">grenade<\/a> and charge towards the player. The player can counter this strategy by grabbing the grenade with the Gravity Gun. The fourth, and final feature, is the addition of <a href=\"\/antlion\/3015-252\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-252\">Antlion<\/a> burrows. These holes will send out an infinite supply of Antlions unless the player manages to cover it with a physics object, such as a car.<\/p><h3>Weapons<\/h3><p>To see a full list of weapons in Half-Life

of Earth once and for all.","description":"<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Half-Life 2: Episode Three, if it is ever released, will be the third and final episode in the <a href=\"\/half-life-2\/3030-1539\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1539\">Half-Life 2<\/a> story arc, following protagonist <a href=\"\/gordon-freeman\/3005-341\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-341\">Gordon Freeman<\/a> as he leads a <a href=\"\/human\/3015-810\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">human<\/a> resistance against the <a href=\"\/the-combine\/3015-64\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-64\">Combine<\/a> forces. Although Episode Three will be the last in the ill-conceived trilogy of extra Half-Life 2 episodes, senior members of <a href=\"\/valve-corporation\/3010-1374\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\">Valve Corporation<\/a> have confirmed that Episode Three will not be the end of the Half-Life franchise.<\/p><p>Little is known about the game at this time, save that, obviously, it will directly follow the events of <a href=\"\/half-life-2-episode-two\/3030-9480\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9480\">Half-Life 2: Episode 2<\/a>. Concept art has hinted that a fight against a <a href=\"\/advisor\/3015-231\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-231\">Combine Advisor<\/a> will take place at some point in this game. Episode Three will likely see partners from the previous games in the Half-Life 2 arc, such as <a href=\"\/barney-calhoun\/3005-642\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-642\">Barney<\/a> and <a href=\"\/alyx-vance\/3005-640\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-640\">Alyx<\/a>, follow Freeman on his journey. Hints from Episode Two suggest that the game will be set far away from <a href=\"\/city-17\/3035-63\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-63\">City 17<\/a> and its outskirts, perhaps in the Arctic or in icy conditions, hailing back to the original design concept for Half-Life 2. Several analysts have interpreted the more open-world design of the final chapters of Episode Two as hinting to a larger, less corridor-based approach to Episode Three.<\/p><p>In an interview with Edge, <a href=\"\/gabe-newell\/3040-4498\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4498\">Gabe Newell<\/a> noted that Episode Three would probably see a change to <a href=\"\/survival-horror\/3015-4801\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4801\">survival horror<\/a> over the franchise's pure action roots. Newell said the series had to broaden its \"emotional palette.\" \"I feel like we've gotten away from genuinely scaring the player more than I'd like, and it's something we need to think about, in addition to broadening the emotional palette we can draw on.\" The game will explore the fans' fears. When asked what he thinks his aging fan-base fears the most, Newell said, \"The death of their children. The fading of their own abilities.\" Newell has confirmed that Freeman will be utterly unchanged in the next game with regards to his superficial behavior -- he will not talk, and he will remain \"an arm and a crowbar.\" \"Right now,\" said Newell,\" making your companions more interesting and compelling seems a more fruitful avenue to explore.\"<\/p><p>The concept of deafness has also been linked to Episode Three. According to Gabe Newell, Episode Three may see the introduction of a deaf character who will interact with <a href=\"\/dog\/3005-737\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-737\">Dog<\/a> and Alyx using sign language (Alyx knows sign language from her experience training Dog). Some have speculated that this may tie in with better support for players with hearing impairment, though this is almost certainly not the case.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><p>Valve's silence on the development status of Episode Three has largely caused the game to be termed \"<a href=\"\/vaporware\/3015-121\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-121\">vaporware<\/a>.\" Although tiny bites of reiterated information, usually in the form of one line responses, habitually emerges from senior ranking members of Valve, their comments pass for little other than confirmation that the game is still in some form of existence. The most recent affirmation came from <a href=\"\/doug-lombardi\/3040-4493\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4493\">Doug Lombardi<\/a> in an interview on the 5th of August, 2010, with <a href=\"\/computer-and-video-games-magazine\/3010-2618\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2618\">Computer and Video Games<\/a>. \"We hate to make you wait, but we have no announcements regarding Mr. Freeman or his ongoing adventures at this time,\" Lombardi said. Fans continue to remain on a constant vigil.<\/p><h3>Alien Swarm<\/h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/28486\/1461079-nodes.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1461079\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.51181102362205\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/28486\/1461079-nodes.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1461079\"><img alt=\"Hints labeled \"Half-Life 2\", \"Episode 3\", and \"Aperture\" were found in the Alien Swarm software developer kit.\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/28486\/1461079-nodes.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/28486\/1461079-nodes.png 635w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/28486\/1461079-nodes.png 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/28486\/1461079-nodes.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Hints labeled \"Half-Life 2\", \"Episode 3\", and \"Aperture\" were found in the Alien Swarm software developer kit.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Following the release of Valve's free game <a href=\"\/alien-swarm\/3030-32098\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32098\">Alien Swarm<\/a>, users found what appeared to be several hints at Episode Three in the Alien Swarm SDK (software developer kit). Among the hint nodes were the labels \"Ep3 Fire Cover Position,\" \"Ep3 Brain Cover Position,\" \"Ep3 Brain Regenerate Position,\" \"Ep3 Spawn Generator Position,\" and \"Aperture: Nest\" (supposedly as in <a href=\"\/aperture-science-enrichment-center\/3035-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-94\">Aperture Science<\/a>, the central corporation from the <a href=\"\/portal\/3025-588\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-588\"><i>Portal<\/i><\/a> franchise, but more likely meant literally, as in \"a hole\"). Hint nodes are used to tell NPCs such as enemies and allies what to do, and how to react in specific situations. A short time later, the community at Steam discovered further hints in the SDK: \"This is a blood color script for the so called blob_brain entity, as you can see it has a decal for FROZEN. Which means it would be some kind of a creature which can be frozen,\" wrote one poster. This would work with the supposed Arctic setting of Episode Three. There are also references to Antlions, Zombies, the Gravity Gun, and one thing labeled \"HL2_EPISODIC.\" The Combine are also mentioned, as well as two types of weapons: the <a href=\"\/tau-cannon\/3055-1790\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1790\">Tau Cannon<\/a>, and Flachettes, the type of projectile fired by the <a href=\"\/hunter\/3015-5111\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5111\">Hunters<\/a>. Valve has a long history of using obscure methods to hint at current projects or secrets about upcoming games. The inclusion of such labeled nodes could simply be their round-about way of confirming that the game is still in development and has not been forgotten.<\/p><h3>September 2010<\/h3><p>In an interview with PC Gamer magazine, Gabe Newell promised that Valve would have \"three big surprises\" to reveal over the twelve-month period to September 2011.<\/p><blockquote><p>\"I can guarantee you people are going to be surprised at stuff we do,\" Newell said. \"That isn't going to stop anytime soon. I'm just laughing because\u2026people will be shocked again.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Newell later confirmed to PC Gamer that Episode Three is in active development and has been for a long time. Newell also revealed that Valve is doing studies on biometrics in house in order to better understand the player base.<\/p><h3>June 15, 2011<\/h3><p>On the Steam forums, a thread entitled \"Half-Life 3 is official confirmed!\" was quickly removed when a former Valve employees', Mike Dussalt, resume revealed his work on Half-Life 3's world programming. The post follows:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"Mike Dussault, a long time programmer at Valve, recently left the company. I didn't know him until last week. Let me introduce myself. I'm a freelance artist. I do contract work for a studio in Seattle, through the internet. They have a client access system on their site. I came across Dussault's resume, while browsing the files section. Now, I know you're all curious about Valve's in-house development, but I'm only going to talk about the Half-Life series.<\/p><p>According to his resume, Episode Three was put on hold when Valve decided to move away from the episodic model in late 2007, right after Episode Two's release. He was a technial advisor on a cancelled Half-Life title, made outside of the company.

They also discovered that Mike Dussault was in fact a real employee at Valve and left the company over a year ago. One other mention of Mike Dussault said that he was a \"technical advisor on a cancelled Half-Life title made outside of the company,\" which was rumored to have been the infamous Episode Four gamers heard about in May 2011. Valve has stated in the past that their interest in episodic material for Half-Life 2 has been lost as of 2007 and there have been new plans for Half-Life mid 2008, after the release of Episode Two. From what ryuuk has said, Dussault has been working on Half-Life 3's world programming since 2008 until his departure in September 2010.<\/p><h3>April 13, 2012<\/h3><p>During the first episode of the 7 Day Cooldown Podcast, Gabe Newell addressed the state of development for the next Half-Life game, by referring to the game, with a wink and a nod, as \"Ricochet 2\". In the interview Newell said the following:<\/p><blockquote><p>\"In terms of <em>Ricochet 2<\/em>, we always have this problem that when we talk about things too far in advance, we end up changing our minds as we're going through and developing stuff, so as we're thinking through the giant story arc which is <em>Ricochet 2<\/em>, you might get to a point where you're saying something is surprising us in a positive way and something is surprising us in a negative way, and, you know, we'd like to be super-transparent about the future of <em>Ricochet 2<\/em>. The problem is, we think that the twists and turns that we're going through would probably drive people more crazy than just being silent about it, until we can be very crisp about what's happening next.\"<\/p><\/blockquote><p><a href=\"\/ricochet\/3030-8093\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8093\">Ricochet<\/a> is an official mod for the first Half-Life game that was released in 2000, and Valve has announced no plans to produce a sequel.<\/p><h3>June 19, 2013<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101014\/2500823-hl3-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2500823\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.52694924123496\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101014\/2500823-hl3-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2500823\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101014\/2500823-hl3-1.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101014\/2500823-hl3-1.png 1911w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/10\/101014\/2500823-hl3-1.png 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/101014\/2500823-hl3-1.png 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101014\/2500823-hl3-1.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101014\/2500823-hl3-1.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/10\/101014\/2500823-hl3-1.png 1911w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/10\/101014\/2500823-hl3-1.png 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/10\/101014\/2500823-hl3-1.png 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/10\/101014\/2500823-hl3-1.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>JIRA is a proprietary issue tracking product used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management.

Additionally, the secondary fire unleashes even more stopping power by firing the second barrel simultaneously with the primary barrel. Although this is a twist on standard shotgun functionality (as a shotgun's secondary barrel simply holds shells) it opens up new possibilities for hostile neutralization. If you find Half-Life 2 to be too easy, try playing through it without the Shotgun; you'll be surprised just how often its immense strength solves your problems.<\/p><ul><li>6 round magazine (30 in reserve).<\/li><li>Reloads one round at a time.<\/li><li>Accurate only at close range but usable at medium-close ranges.<\/li><li>Ideal at close range.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Crossbow<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/637842-hl2_0028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637842\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.38280542986425\" data-width=\"1105\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1105px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:38.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/637842-hl2_0028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637842\"><img alt=\"Crossbow\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10392\/637842-hl2_0028.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 1105w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/10392\/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/10392\/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10392\/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Crossbow\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10392\/637842-hl2_0028.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 1105w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/10392\/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/10392\/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10392\/637842-hl2_0028.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Crossbow<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>An overly physics-inspired <a href=\"\/sniper-rifle\/3055-67\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\">sniper rifle<\/a>.

The crossbow fires an electrically superheated copper rod great distances and can pin unsuspecting Combine soldiers to walls and objects, leaving them to flop around in the most glorious of <a href=\"\/ragdoll-physics\/3015-118\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-118\">ragdoll<\/a> fashions. Unfortunately, the rod qualifies as a standard projectile, meaning that it has travel time and is affected by gravity. This forces players to make two separate corrections to their aim if firing at range: one for the drop in height and one to anticipate their target's motions. Thankfully, the crossbow at least has a right-click zoom function identical to the suit's except that you can actually fire while using it. The Crossbow is, ironically, hardest to use at sniping distances and is more than powerful enough to used against enemies in direct conflict. The ragdoll pinning is also always a plus.<\/p><ul><li>1 round magazine (8 in reserve).<\/li><li>Accurate at any range with proper aim correction.<\/li><li>Ideal at medium-long range.<\/li><\/ul><h3>RPG<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/637814-hl2_0032.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637814\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66469282013323\" data-width=\"1351\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1351px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/637814-hl2_0032.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-637814\"><img alt=\"RPG\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10392\/637814-hl2_0032.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 1351w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/10392\/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/10392\/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10392\/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"RPG\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10392\/637814-hl2_0032.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/10392\/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 1351w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/10392\/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/10392\/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/10392\/637814-hl2_0032.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>RPG<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Arguably the most fun twist on a standard firearm in the game.

This means that the grenade's explosion may be nowhere near where you threw the thing in the first place; depending on how it lands, the grenade can roll a considerably long way (or it might not roll at all). Make sure that any grenade you throw explodes before moving into the area--you'll have no good idea where it will explode unless you can see it.

The source engine includes a heavily modified version of the <a href=\"..\/..\/havok-physics\/92-502\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Havok physics engine<\/a> that allows for more environmental interactivity during both single-player and online play.<\/p><h4>Notable Technology<\/h4><ul><li><a href=\"..\/..\/hdr-high-dynamic-range\/92-618\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">High dynamic range rendering<\/a><\/li><li>Lag compensating network communications<\/li><li>Network-enabled and bandwidth-efficient <a href=\"..\/..\/physics-manipulation\/92-88\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">physics<\/a> <a href=\"..\/..\/havok-physics\/92-502\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">engine<\/a><\/li><li>Future-proof multiprocessor support<\/li><li>Facial animation system<\/li><li>Blended skeletal animation system<\/li><li>Full-screen <a href=\"..\/..\/motion-blur\/92-248\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">motion blur<\/a><\/li><li>Dynamic lighting and shadowing<\/li><\/ul><h3>Source Code Leak<\/h3><p>Half-life 2 was merely a rumor until being officially unveiled at <a href=\"\/e3\/3015-3168\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3168\">E3<\/a> May 2003. The game then received huge amounts of hype and won many awards for best in show. Initially the game had a release date of September 2003, but it missed that date. Leading up to the original September release date, Valve fell into an unexpected media blackout, providing almost no information whatsoever on the progress of the game as it was supposed to be being completed. After the September date had come and gone with no information from Valve, Half-Life 2's complete source code was leaked online along with other private internal Valve documents showing that the game was not yet complete and ready for release. Valve finally broke their silence and admitted that the game would be delayed for a year. This massive leak of private information was due to a major breach of <a href=\"\/valve-corporation\/3010-1374\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\">Valve<\/a>'s internal network through a null session connection to Tangis which was hosted in Valve's network and subsequent upload of an ASP shell.<\/p><p>In June 2004, Valve issued a press release stating that the FBI had arrested several people suspected of involvement in the source code leak. Valve claimed the game had been leaked by a German black-hat hacker named Axel Gembe. Gembe later contacted Valve CEO <a href=\"\/gabe-newell\/3040-4498\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4498\">Gabe Newell<\/a> thinking that Valve wanted to employ him as an in-house security auditor, to which Valve feigned interest to bait him for arrest. He was to be offered a flight to the USA and then immediately arrested on arrival, but the German government learned of the plan and arrested Gembe themselves.<\/p><p>In November of 2006, in Germany, Gembe was sentenced to two years probation because the judge felt Gembe had a difficult childhood and was working on his problems.<\/p><h3>Continuing Support<\/h3><p>In January of 2012, members of the Steam Community group \"A Call for Communication (Half-Life)\" organized a massive community playdate called in Half-Life 2 to show their continuing support for Valve and the Half-Life franchise. Scheduled for February 4th, \"A Red Letter Day\" (an homage to Half-Life 2's second level) was intended to bring the game into the top ten most-played Steam games of the day by garnering as many concurrent players as possible. In total, the event put 13,126 players online at the same time, more than ten times that average for the past year.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\"

A team-based first-person shooter, the game pits players against each other in series of counter-terrorism situations, splitting people up between terrorists and counter-terrorists. Basic Counter-Strike gameplay centers on the two teams of players attempting to either wipe out the other team or complete a specific mission objective. These objectives usually involve planting a bomb, saving hostages, or assassinating a VIP. At the start of each round, players are given several seconds to purchase equipment with money gained at the start of each game and through their performance in the previous round. When a player is killed, he or she become a spectator, and must wait until the round is completed to play again.<\/p><h2>Popularity<\/h2><p>The popularity of the Counter-Strike franchise has been nothing short of phenomenal, and for a while the original Half-Life mod was the most-played online game in the world. Subsequent releases of the series over the years (including a standalone version of the game, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5722\" href=\"\/counter-strike-condition-zero\/3030-5722\/\">Condition Zero<\/a>) have featured various graphical improvements but altered gameplay and physics, which have been criticisms of the most recent edition, Counter-Strike: Source. These new releases have divided the player base. As more and newer First Person Shooters have come out, the series has lost some of its lustre, and no new Counter Strike games have been announced. Nevertheless, the influence of the series in mainstream game development has been extreme and easily noticeable in other franchises such as <a data-ref-id=\"3025-240\" href=\"\/unreal-tournament\/3025-240\/\">Unreal Tournament<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"\/call-of-duty\/3025-82\/\">Call of Duty<\/a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-51\" href=\"\/battlefield\/3025-51\/\">Battlefield<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Counter-Strike and e-Sports<\/h2><p>After its creation, Counter-Strike quickly amassed a huge amount of competitive players. Leagues such as the OGL (Online Gaming League) and CAL (Cyberathlete Amateur league) began to offer different ladders and divisions for competition. As time wore on, and new versions of Counter-Strike were released, CAL turned into the most highly played and most competitive league, with the Cal Invite division (Cal-I) being the most competitive online league. As the online leagues underwent rapid growth and teams such as 3D and SK became big organizations, LAN event organizers stood up and took notice. Counter-Strike became the premier game at the WCG (World Cyber Games), the ESWC (Electronic Sports World Cup), the WEG (World e-Sports Games, and, most notably, the CPL (Cyberathlete Professional League) between 2000-2007. When the CPL began their summer and winter events in the early 2000's, it became the premier tournament for Counter-Strike teams. Almost always held in Dallas, Texas, teams traveled from across the world to take part in this event. Combined with CAL, their partner online league, these organizations formed the mainstay of tournament Counter-Strike.<\/p><p>The United States and Sweden are generally recognised as the biggest forces in professional Counter-Strike throughout its history, with Norway, Poland, Germany, France and Brazil all popping up with event-winning teams at times. Players such as Ksharp, HeatoN, potti, element, f0rest, fr0d, sunman, and tr1p all became iconic figures with their clans as the major teams dominated and fought for the number one spot at major tournaments year in and year out. There would be total prize purses in excess of 150,000 dollars at the biggest tournaments for Counter-Strike, with prizes for first place between 15,000 to 60,000 dollars. Teams such as 3D, SK, NiP, fnatic, MYM, coL, NoA, team9, hoorai, JMC, MiBR, and PGS were all dominant during this period, which is considered by many competitive Counter-Strike's \"golden age\". Another major league opened during this time, CEVO (Cyberevolution), a pay-to-play league that became as important as Cal-I at its height. Websites such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gotfrag.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">gotFrag<\/a> became vastly-followed sites due to their coverage of Counter-Strike leagues, events and teams. LAN events were commonplace throughout the United States, even for amateurs to enter. CAL at one point had 5 different divisions for Counter-Strike: Open, Intermediate, Main, Premier, and Invite, all with regional brackets except for Invite. During this period Counter-Strike had a seemingly endless online following and a plethora of LAN events, with both amateurs and professionals making it the biggest, most competitive e-Sport in the world.<\/p><h4>Counter-Strike: Source and the fall of competitive Counter-Strike<\/h4><p>After many years of Counter-Strike plateauing at version 1.6, which was the tournament and league standard, Valve released Counter-Strike's sequel, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11339\" href=\"\/counter-strike-source\/3030-11339\/\">Counter-Strike: Source<\/a>, in October of 2004. With completely updated graphics and much shallower learning curve, it became widely played and opened up new markets for Counter-Strike.. However, as many professional players hated the new gameplay, tournaments stayed with 1.6 for a couple of years. However, as Source's popularity grew, and new leagues such the Championship Gaming Series (the first televised gaming league) opened, teams began to migrate to Source.<\/p><p>The dam broke in 2006-2007, when most major North American teams such as 3D, coL, and JMC all moved to Counter-Strike Source because it was seen as the future of competitive Counter-Strike. The CPL selected Source as its team-based shooter, and the community quickly fragmented. Everyone praised Counter-Strike 1.6's gameplay, which many considered the best of any first-person shooter, but its dated graphics left major video card sponsors angry, as they couldn't use 1.6 as a means to promote video card sales. As such, when Counter-Strike Source was released, these companies pushed for its support from leagues, and got it. This deeply fragmented the Counter-Strike community, as the gameplay of 1.6 was seen as better due to it being harder to learn and less random. Also, since many people had been played 1.6 for 3 or more years, they resisted this change. Further fragmentation occurred when nearly all of Europe stayed with 1.6 just as the best teams in America were switching to Source. This caused the dissolution of the compelling US-Europe rivalry that had always been present in competitive Counter-Strike. In recent years, this trend has continued, with Source being picked up by more and more North American teams and leagues, while Europe continues to play 1.6. Due to this, the competitive scene in both games is seen as \"incomplete\", due to the other game still being popular. As a result, other games such as World of Warcraft and Call of Duty 4 have gained popularity, and even though both 1.6 and Source are widely played, the competitive scene has since dwindled, with recently the CPL ceasing operations due to a lack of funds and interest.<\/p><h2>Xbox Port<\/h2><p>Due to the success of Counter-Strike on the personal computer, Valve decided to port the popular game to the Xbox, it was released in Fall 2003.

However, Shepard never really receives these orders; he is separated from his unit early in the offensive, and attempts to reunite with his squad for the first part of the game. He finally reconnects with his squad, but is left behind when the mass evacuation of the facility begins. Shepard, along with other soldiers left behind, attempt to find a way out of the facility, expressing their lack of enthusiasm for their orders.<\/p><p>Shepard ultimately catches up with Freeman, and watches as he enters the <a href=\"\/xen\/3035-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-75\"> Xen<\/a> relay and escapes from Black Mesa.

Ultimately, Shepard encounters the mysterious <a href=\"\/g-man\/3005-421\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-421\"> G-Man<\/a>, who compliments him on his resilience and adaptability in such dire circumstances. Unlike Freeman, the G-Man does not offer Shepard employment, and instead leaves him in stasis on a tram seemingly careening through outer space.

The Wrench is significantly slower than the Crowbar was, although much more powerful.

First introduced in the training sequence at the start of the game, it too featured a zoom feature for long-range enemy elimination.<\/p><h3>M249 SAW Light Machine Gun<\/h3><p>Another military weapon, Opposing Force features a <a href=\"\/m249-saw-mg\/3055-623\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-623\"> SAW<\/a> LMG, which has both a rapid rate of fire and massive clip size, and is quite useful for engaging multiple targets or laying down suppressive fire.<\/p><h3>Displacer<\/h3><p>The experimental weapon featured in Opposing Force appears to be some sort of portable teleporter, or some early attempt at one. However, Shepard uses this experimental technology for more macabre purposes, and uses it as a weapon. Its primary fire launches a portal torwards an enemy, and teleports them far away from Shepard, or destroys them (the technology is unstable, after all). It's alternate fire transports Shepard himself to Xen, for good or bad. Teleportation can either kill Shepard or help him move past an obstacle.<\/p><h3>Barnacle<\/h3><p>This expansion also introduced a host of new Alien weaponry, including the Barnacle, which is essentially a hand-held version of the Barnacle enemy encountered many times in the game. Firing the barnacle launches it's long tongue at a target enemy, dragging it close and dealing damage until it is fully digested. It is also used as a method of travelling across otherwise inaccessible gaps, by attaching its tongue to specific, stationary spores and dragging the player closer to the targeted spore.<\/p><h3>Spore Launcher<\/h3><p>Speaking of Spores, another new Alien weapon was just that, a living weapon which fired spores at enemies. The spore launcher actually swallows the ammo fed into it, and spits out the explosive ammunition upon command. By holding down the alternate fire, the Spore Launcher charges up a shot before firing it. Spores actually bounce a bit if not targeted directly at an enemy, so take careful aim.<\/p><h3>Shock Roach<\/h3><p>Another living weapon, the Shock Roach is a giant bug that fires electricity at enemies. Like the Hive Arm it replaced, the Shock Roach regenerates ammunition up to eight shots, but each shot does less damage than the preceding one. It is not recommended firing this weapon underwater; it is instant death.<\/p><h2>New Equipment<\/h2><h3>Body Armor<\/h3><p>Though it wouldn't make much sense for Adrian Shepard to be wearing the HEV suit worn by Gordon throughout Half-Life, the same system takes place, by charging Shepard's high-tech Body Armour, much in the same fashion one would charge the HEV suit. In fact, the Body Armor charges using either specifically Body Armour chargers or the more common HEV charging stations throughout the Black Mesa Facility.<\/p><h3>Night Vision<\/h3><p>Unlike the HEV suit, Shepard's Body Armor does not come equpped with a flashlight, and he must instead rely on his helmet and Night Vision to illuminate the darker corners of Black Mesa. The Night Vision is used in essentially the same way the flashlight was in Half-Life.<\/p><h2>Squad Management<\/h2><p>Opposing Force introduces a new AI system, and allows the player to have a squad of allied soldiers, who can assist in various situations and provide additional fire support. There are several different classes of soldiers, all of which are able to assist Shepard in various ways.<\/p><h3>Soldiers<\/h3><p>Just a typical grunt, Soldiers are best used to provide additional fire and protection against the many hazards of Black Mesa. However, they can occasionally provide ammo to Shepard when needed.<\/p><h3>Medics<\/h3><p>As the name says, Medics can provide healing in addition to standard soldier duties. This makes Medics one of the more valuable allies to have around, as they can keep Shepard healthy and happy. Occasionally, a Medic can be required to move the plot forward, if there is a soldier who needs medical attention in order to open a blocked path, though for the most part they are not <i>necessary<\/i> to keep around.<\/p><h3>Engineers<\/h3><p>Soldiers that carry a blow torch and supplies, these chain-smokers can break through otherwise inaccessible doors, either to advance the plot, or occasionally, to open up a secret area (usually by keeping them alive for a long period of time). If an Engineer encounters a door, he should automatically attempt to break through, unless there are enemies nearby that must be taken care of.<\/p><h2>Voice Cast<\/h2><ul><li><a href=\"\/jon-st-john\/3040-1962\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1962\"> Jon St. John<\/a>, the voice of Duke Nukem, lent his voice for senior drill instructor Dwight T.

Despite lacking most of the story that Half Life 2 originally had, the G-Man Character is still featured in this edition. Survivor runs on the <a data-ref-id=\"3010-135\" href=\"\/taito-corporation\/3010-135\/\">  Taito<\/a>'s  Type X  with a 32\" attached monitor running at 1360x768. This version also supports Local Area Play, which is similar to Half Life 2: Death Match, it features 4v.4 play. Although the gameplay is not a carbon copy of Half Life 2, it resembles it a lot.<div><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><\/div><div><p>Players control their movement using two joysticks (one for each hand) and floor pedals. Three gameplay modes are available: Story, which approximates the events of the original game; Mission, which forces networked players to work cooperatively toward a goal; and Battle, which parallels the deathmatch content of the original game. Up to eight players\u2014either local players or individuals in other networked arcades\u2014can participate in the Battle and Mission modes.<\/p><p>In Story mode, players advance through partial combat scenes from the original game, following neon-lit guiding arrows. Each chapter has several levels with goals such as \"Kill Combines\" or \"Find your way to the goal\". When goals are completed, the player is taken to next level. When players finish all the levels of the chapter, the game ends. Progress can be saved on a removable card to allow the player to choose a new chapter at the next visit. Aside from the G-man introductory cut-scene,\u00a0<i>Half Life 2: Survivor<\/i>\u00a0does not incorporate any of Half Life 2's story elements, levels, or physics-based puzzles.<\/p><p>In Mission mode, there are three objective maps with three difficulties: normal, hard, and super hard. Map goals include \"Collect gems\", \"Destroy Zombie spawning points\", and \"Escape\". A Battle mode is also available in the game. It is essentially four-on-four team match. Players can choose between two different factions: the Combine and the Human Resistance. Both factions have four classes of troops: Ranger, Soldier, Sniper, and Engineer.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><div><p>The game uses content common to the Xbox and PC releases, although the game focuses on the set pieces that characterized the original game.<i>Half-Life 2: Survivor<\/i>\u00a0was first revealed to the public by Taito in a private exhibition in Tokyo on November 29, 2005. It was originally meant to be released in March 2006 but it was pushed back to June 28, 2006. The game is only available in Japan.<\/p><p>The game runs on a machine based on Taito's Type X unit, an arcade system built with PC components, which runs on the Windows XP Embedded operating system. The game machine's cabinet uses a 32 inch LCD screen which runs at a resolution of 1360x768 pixels. The machine also has a 5.1-channel surround sound system, and it uses a smart card for storing player data. Because the game is network-enabled, players in different arcades are able to play with each other. A maximum of eight players can play in the same match; robots are used to fill in empty player slots if there are less than eight human players.<\/p><\/div><\/div>","expected_release_day":28,"expected_release_month":6,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":2006,"guid":"3030-22721","id":22721,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/425481-hl2s.jpg","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/425481-hl2s.jpg","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/425481-hl2s.jpg","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/425481-hl2s.jpg","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/425481-hl2s.jpg","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/425481-hl2s.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/425481-hl2s.jpg","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/425481-hl2s.jpg","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/425481-hl2s.jpg","image_tags":"All Images"},"image_tags":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-22721\/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images","name":"All Images","total":2},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-22721\/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art","name":"Box Art","total":1},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-22721\/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots","name":"Screenshots","total":1}],"name":"Half Life 2: Survivor","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":null,"original_release_date":null,"platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-84\/","id":84,"name":"Arcade","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/arcade\/3045-84\/","abbreviation":"ARC"}],"site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/half-life-2-survivor\/3030-22721\/","resource_type":"game"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-52612\/","date_added":"2016-02-08 22:37:22","date_last_updated":"2016-02-09 16:23:07","deck":"A Sci-Fi puzzle game, where players compete solve deadly traps on a futuristic game show.","description":"<h2> The Lore<\/h2><p>In the distant future, the prison system has been full privatized.

It was developed by Westone, better known for the much more lighthearted Wonder Boy series, and published by RPG giant Enix.<\/p><p>The player alternates between Rukyu, a demonic overlord who commands the forces of darkness to raze villages to the ground in order to absorb their soul energy, and the paladin Falco, who visits these destroyed towns and helps its souls find peace. The goal of Rukyu's chapters is to find and eliminate Falco which will sever his benevolent God Rudo's connection to the world, and Falco's is similarly to eliminate Rukyu to prevent the destruction of the world. <\/p><p>The game was released late in the Super Famicom's lifespan and never saw an English localization, though a long-in-production fan translation was picked up and completed by the Aeon Genesis group in 2015.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>The game adopts an isometric perspective which persists in the grid-based tactical battles. Each chapter has the player alternate between Falco and Rukyu, who have similar combat mechanics but play very differently. One constant is the use of \"soul points\": a resource that constantly ticks down as they move around the map. Falco needs soul points to maintain his connection to his God Rudo, and spends them to perform magic spells in combat. Rukyu's magic is also powered by soul points and so he needs them to maintain his physical form in the world. If either character loses all their soul points, the game is over.<\/p><p>Falco's chapters are a more traditional RPG experience. He can acquire companions and must purchase new weapons and equipment to survive. Rukyu doesn't use equipment, and instead of human companions acquires monster followers that act on their own prerogative. Rukyu must acquire new soul points to power his spells by murdering townspeople, and many of his chapters involve attacking towns with his monstrous minions.<\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p>","expected_release_day":31,"expected_release_month":5,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":1996,"guid":"3030-8116","id":8116,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/2244766-dark_half_cover.jpg","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/2244766-dark_half_cover.jpg","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/2244766-dark_half_cover.jpg","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/2244766-dark_half_cover.jpg","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/2244766-dark_half_cover.jpg","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/2244766-dark_half_cover.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/2244766-dark_half_cover.jpg","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/2244766-dark_half_cover.jpg","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/2244766-dark_half_cover.jpg","image_tags":"All Images,Box Art"},"image_tags":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-8116\/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images","name":"All Images","total":27},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-8116\/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art","name":"Box Art","total":1},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-8116\/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots","name":"Screenshots","total":26},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-8116\/?filter=image_tag%3ASNES+Screenshots","name":"SNES Screenshots","total":26}],"name":"Dark Half","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":null,"original_release_date":null,"platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-9\/","id":9,"name":"Super Nintendo Entertainment System","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/super-nintendo-entertainment-system\/3045-9\/","abbreviation":"SNES"}],"site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/dark-half\/3030-8116\/","resource_type":"game"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-71109\/","date_added":"2018-11-21 16:12:45","date_last_updated":"2019-08-05 15:53:18","deck":".","description":null,"expected_release_day":20,"expected_release_month":11,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":2018,"guid":"3030-71109","id":71109,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/3064816-logoitch.png","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/3064816-logoitch.png","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/3064816-logoitch.png","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/3064816-logoitch.png","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/3064816-logoitch.png","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/3064816-logoitch.png","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/3064816-logoitch.png","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/3064816-logoitch.png","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/3064816-logoitch.png","image_tags":"All Images"},"image_tags":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-71109\/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images","name":"All Images","total":1}],"name":"Evidence of Life","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":null,"original_release_date":null,"platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-94\/","id":94,"name":"PC","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/pc\/3045-94\/","abbreviation":"PC"}],"site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/evidence-of-life\/3030-71109\/","resource_type":"game"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-62534\/","date_added":"2017-11-10 14:56:25","date_last_updated":"2018-10-03 12:33:46","deck":"CardLife is an online crafting and survival game which takes place entirely in a world made out of cardboard.

This mode is unlocked from the start.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are many missions in Hero 30, with many branching paths. The player controls the blond, nameless<a href=\"\/hero-half-minute-hero\/3005-14905\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14905\"> Hero<\/a>. Each mission starts off with the <a href=\"\/boss-fight\/3015-50\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\"> boss<\/a> of the level giving their speech, then Hero will start with <a href=\"\/doomsday-clock\/3015-1569\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1569\"> 30 seconds<\/a> to stop the Evil Lord. To defeat the boss Hero must level up and buy equipment and other items to help him on his quest. He can sprint to skip enemy encounters, but his HP will decrease as he sprints. If he dies, he will restart at the beginning with 10 HP.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Warping Time<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Time only stops during cutscenes and in towns, houses, or friendly castles (unless the player is on the hard difficulty). But if the player runs low on time, Hero can visit a Time Goddess statue. By paying some of the gold Hero receives from battles to <a href=\"\/putt-putt-travels-through-time\/3030-931\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-931\"> reset time<\/a> back to 30 seconds. It costs 100 the first time, but gradually goes up the more times the player resets time in a level. 200 for the second time, 300 for the 3rd, etc. If Hero does not have enough money, he can trade all of his equipment for one final time reset. Hero will give his equipment to the Time Goddess after the mission is over.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Healing Items<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In towns, Hero can spend gold to buy healing items. There are two main kinds. Regular food heals him instantly. While herbs can be saved and used at the press of a button. There are also some added effects, such as increasing Max HP.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Equipment<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Like in any RPG, Hero is able to buy equipment such as <a href=\"\/sword\/3055-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\"> swords<\/a> or <a href=\"\/helmet\/3055-737\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-737\"> helmets<\/a> to increase his stats. They can also find new equipment in the environment. Stats are as follows:<\/p><ul><li>Attack- Increases the damage Hero deals.<\/li><li>Defense- Reduces the damage Hero takes and reduces how far he gets knocked back.<\/li><li>Speed- Increases walking speed on the main map and in battle.<\/li><\/ul><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Day Cycles<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are three different parts of the day that can be experienced.<\/p><ol><li>30.00 to 20.01 seconds- Morning<\/li><li>20.00 to 10.01 seconds- Afternoon<\/li><li>10.00 to 0.00 seconds- Evening<\/li><\/ol><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Some missions have certain events that happen at the certain time of the day.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">For example, a cave that has a rare item might have tough monsters at all times except for the evening.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">World Map and Branching Paths<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The quest map is open, and there are <a href=\"\/branching-story-line\/3015-1646\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1646\"> various paths<\/a> to take. Most are determined by accomplishing (or not accomplishing) a certain goal. If Hero stops <a href=\"\/bandit\/3015-3588\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3588\"> bandits<\/a> from burning down a forest in one stage, that opens up the north path. If he lets the forest burn he will be forced to go south. Most paths lead to different missions, but if one fails to fulfill a certain goal, the <a href=\"\/game-over\/3015-372\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-372\"> game ends.<\/a> The player is often encouraged to try multiple branches for new equipment before moving onto more difficult stages.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Time Attack<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After beating a quest, the player may go back and try to beat it again in a faster time. The Time Goddess will not allow the Hero to use new weapons or equipment - which is to say, items that are not available before the stage begins. There are many different <a href=\"\/ranking-system\/3015-2163\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2163\"> ranks<\/a> based on how fast the Hero completes each mission such as \"Sucky Hero\" and \"Wonderful Hero.\"<\/p><h3>Evil Lord 30<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><i>\"Goddess Era 200...A beautiful evil lord tries to lift the curse on his lover and destroy all evil!<\/i> <i>Continue summoning monsters for 30 seconds!<\/i> <i>The beautiful battle against humans in a <b>Real Time Strategy Game!<\/b><\/i>\"<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This is a real-time strategy mode. This mode is unlocked from the start.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The playable character is the Beautiful Evil Lord (who makes an appearance in Hero 30) and must <a href=\"\/summoning\/3015-99\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-99\"> summon<\/a> a variety of monsters in order to defeat hordes of heroes and bosses. The Beautiful Evil Lord is largely inspired by <a href=\"\/psaro-the-manslayer\/3005-7517\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7517\">Psaro the Manslayer<\/a> from <a href=\"\/dragon-quest-iv-chapters-of-the-chosen\/3030-22703\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22703\">Dragon Quest IV<\/a>, though takes elements from various other androgynous anti-heroes and sympathetic villains.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Battle System<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game utilizes a <a href=\"\/rock-paper-scissors\/3015-539\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-539\"> RPS<\/a> style battle system, where the Beautiful Evil Lord is able to summon three kinds of monsters. Each strong to another type.<\/p><ul><li>Brutes are the typical strong melee type, strong to Nimbles, weak to Shooters.<\/li><li>Nimbles are the speed type. Strong to Shooters, weak to Brutes.<\/li><li>Shooters are the long range type. Strong to Brutes, weak to Nimbles.<\/li><\/ul><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Summoning Circle<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Beautiful Evil Lord starts with a summoning circle that grows in size as he levels up. As he summons creatures, the circle shrinks.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The bigger the circle, the stronger the monster he summons. The circle regrows as he spends time recharging, but the circle will shrink if he gets hurt.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Fabulous Four<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are 4 Spirits the Beautiful Evil Lord can save in side missions to aid him. Once he finds them in a mission, he can use their special attack.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Once he saves them, they will randomly appear in other missions, and he can save up their power to use when he wants.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Time Goddess<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Time Goddess appears in this mode, but works in a different way.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">She will be hiding out in a golden barrel. If the Beautiful Evil Lord touches the barrel he will reset time at the cost of all his coins.<\/p><h3>Princess 30<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><i>\"Goddess Era 300...A kind-hearted princess goes outside the castle in search of a medicinal herb to cure her father's illness!<\/i><\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><i>Guarded by her loyal soldiers she shoots arrows in this <b>High Speed Shooting Game!<\/b> She's got a 30 second curfew!?<\/i>\"<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Princess 30 is a 2D shooter mode. This mode is unlocked from the start.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The playable character in this mode is the Princess on top on a group of soldiers and she must complete a variety of tasks while fending off enemies with arrows to complete the 30 second quests.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">She can shoot in all directions and move in all directions. Most missions have her going out and retrieving an item, then racing back to the castle before the gate shuts.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Soldiers<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Princess starts out with 30 soldiers carrying her. As she gets hit, she loses soldiers. The more soldiers she has, the higher her rate of fire. Her speed also increases.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">She can never lose all of her soldiers, and will always keep two. Soldiers will <a href=\"\/respawn\/3015-989\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-989\"> respawn<\/a> after some time.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Time Goddess<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Time Goddess appears in a different way. She will lay out a red carpet throughout certain parts of the stage. When she steps on the red carpet, her remaining time will go up (to a max of 30 seconds) while her gold will go down as she is riding over the red carpet.<\/p><h3>Knight 30<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><i>Goddess Era 500...With the Time Goddess gone, a salvaged knight and a sage set off on a journey. Using all sorts of actions, <\/i><i>he will defend the sage for 30 seconds no matter how many times he dies. <b>Death Defying Action Game!<\/b><\/i><\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Knight 30 is a <a href=\"\/real-time-combat\/3015-2332\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2332\"> RTS<\/a>-type mode. This mode is unlocked after completing the first three modes (Hero, Evil Lord, and Princess)<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The playable character is the Knight and Sage, and the Knight must defend the Sage from an onslaught of monsters for 30 seconds so the spell can be cast. The sage can cast spells to assist the knight, but he is venerable and must be defended.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Reverse Time<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The difference in this mode is that the player wants time to go down to zero. When time runs out, the spell is cast and the mission is complete.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Knight can pull the Sage around by his hand, or he can carry him. Time does not go down while carrying the sage.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are also some enchanted areas which allows time to decrease at a higher rate.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">How HP Works<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Since the Knight cannot lose by time running out, the only way he can die is if the Sage dies. The Sage can be hit 4 times before he dies and the game ends. The Knight has a certain amount of <a href=\"\/stamina-bar\/3015-3569\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3569\"> Stamina<\/a> (for sprinting) and HP. If the Knight runs out of HP, he will also die, but the Sage will be able to summon his ghost. As the ghost, the Knight must find his way back to his body.<\/p><h4 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Weapons<\/h4><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are many traps that can be used to slow\/stop the enemies' advance. The Knight has 8 hours the night before a mission.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Making each weapon takes 3 hours (but leveling up reduces the time necessary).<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"\/scarecrow\/3055-2446\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2446\"> Scarecrow<\/a>-replica of the sage, attracts birds<\/li><li>Fence- A makeshift barricade<\/li><li>Horse Meat- Attracts beasts and bugs<\/li><li><a href=\"\/bomb\/3055-97\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-97\"> Bomb<\/a>- Destroys objects<\/li><li>Land Trap- Floor spikes that hurt enemies passing over.<\/li><\/ul><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In addition to the traps, there are various melee weapons the Knight can use such as <a href=\"\/shovel\/3055-427\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-427\"> shovels<\/a> or broken swords.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Once small enemies are stunned, he can pick them up and throw them. He can also jump on big enemies and spin them.<\/p><h3>Hero 300<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><i>\"Goddess Era 500...Ultimate Evil Lord has awaken! The ancient heroes gather to save what is left of humanity<\/i>.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><i>Armageddon...has begun. Only <b>300 seconds<\/b> until the world collapses.<\/i> \"<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Hero 300 is a RPG-type mode. It is unlocked after completing Knight 30. The playable character is Hero again.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This is the final battle of the story mode, as the title implies, Hero has 300 seconds (five minutes) to save the world.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">All five heroes (Hero, Evil Lord, Princess, Knight, Sage) must team up to stop the Ultimate Evil Lord.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Hero starts out with nothing, so he will start out with cheap items (wooden sword, sandals) and must eventually work his way to better items.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Time Goddess isn't in this mode, but there are various checkpoints Hero must reach. Usually every 60 seconds. Seeing as time cannot be reset, it's imperative for Hero to make these checkpoints if he has any hope of winning.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">If Hero fails, the player must restart the ENTIRE mission. This creates the need to think of a long term strategy, something not needed until now.<\/p><h3>Hero 3<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">\"There will be a bonus for the hero that finishes the battle. A sadistically hard retro game! Save the world in 3 seconds! <b>Super High Speed RPG<\/b>\"<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Hero 3 is a RPG-type mode. It is unlocked after completing Hero 300.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As the title implies, the player has THREE seconds.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Like Hero 300, the player needs a well planned strategy, but they also need pinpoint execution.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The player is able to reset time, but with only 3 seconds. There is no room for error. There is only one level in Hero 3 mode. Completing it unlocks the game's soundtrack.<\/p><h2>Main Characters<\/h2><ul><li style=\"margin-right:0px;\"><b>Hero<\/b>: A former traveler that happened to be in the right (wrong?) place at the right time, making him the Hero.<\/li><li style=\"margin-right:0px;\"><b>Time Goddess<\/b>: Controls time, and needs a hero to help save the world.

It follows a living pixel on a journey through gaming hardware of the past, visiting levels based on 8- and 16-bit computer games.  Each world, represented by a particular platform, consists of 8 levels; to exit the level Pixel must collect all the gems in that level and then proceed to an exit door.<\/p><p>Most levels have obstacles, ranging from moving spikes, bottomless chasms, temporary blocks and water to more complex enemies that move around randomly or shoot at the player. Pixel has limited health, and can survive only one encounter with moving enemies, and will die instantly on contact with static obstacles; levels have no checkpoints and must be replayed from the beginning each time, but can generally be completed in a few minutes or less.<\/p><p>Levels often contain 'secrets' - levels in 8-bit worlds each contain a special collectible (usually visible, but difficult to reach) that unlock another computer when all are collected, and unlocking the final 8 levels require collecting another 50 extra-hidden items. Levels also occasionally include other items such as vehicles or jetpacks, or potions that allow Pixel to kill moving enemies by jumping on them.<\/p><p>Platforms, and the individual levels within them, are unlocked by completing the previous one, but can be replayed freely afterwards.

For instance, the earliest playable levels are entirely in black and white and are only as large as the screen, but later levels eventually reach full-colour - with the exception of the Game Boy, which returns to a green-tinted monochrome - and progress from scrolling between segments to limited one-directional scrolling to full movement with background parallax.<\/p><p>To a limited extent, enemies are also linked to the various eras, with more complex enemies (such as a small tank that fires projectiles) introduced after a flying bat\/ghost, in turn introduced after an octopus-like creature that moves only sideways with no reaction to the player.<\/p><p>On the other hand, gameplay itself is generally the same throughout the worlds. For instance, Pixel is capable of double-jumping from the very beginning, enemies behave the same whenever they appear, and levels are designed to fit a widescreen aspect ratio.<\/p>","expected_release_day":9,"expected_release_month":1,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":2013,"guid":"3030-40914","id":40914,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/2667728-3929519007-Title.png","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/2667728-3929519007-Title.png","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/2667728-3929519007-Title.png","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/2667728-3929519007-Title.png","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/2667728-3929519007-Title.png","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/2667728-3929519007-Title.png","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/2667728-3929519007-Title.png","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/2667728-3929519007-Title.png","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/2667728-3929519007-Title.png","image_tags":"All

(known in Japan as <em>Tomodachi Collection: New Life<\/em>) is a comedic life simulator developed by <a href=\"\/nintendo-spd-group-no1\/3010-7280\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7280\">Nintendo SPD Group 1<\/a> and published by <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo<\/a> for the <a href=\"\/nintendo-3ds\/3045-117\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS<\/a> (both retail and <a href=\"\/nintendo-3ds-eshop\/3045-138\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-138\">eShop<\/a>) on April 18, 2013 (in Japan) and June 6, 2014 (worldwide).<\/p><p>The sequel to the Japan-exclusive <a href=\"\/nintendo-ds\/3045-52\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS<\/a> game <a href=\"\/tomodachi-collection\/3030-23982\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23982\">Tomodachi Collection<\/a>, players can import their <a href=\"\/mii-support\/3015-270\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-270\">Miis<\/a> from their Nintendo 3DS's Mii Maker (or from <a href=\"\/qr-codes\/3015-7273\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7273\">QR Codes<\/a>) and have them live together in an apartment complex on a secluded <a href=\"\/island\/3035-2801\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2801\">island<\/a>.<\/p><p>By interacting with their Miis and resolving their frustrations, players can unlock more shops (selling clothing, gifts, food, and apartment styles) and activities (for the Miis to partake in). Naturally, the Miis (who have different <a href=\"\/personality-quiz\/3015-7098\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7098\">personality traits<\/a>) will want to meet and regularly interact with each-other, developing <a href=\"\/friendship\/3015-2084\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2084\">friendships<\/a>, rivalries, and maybe <a href=\"\/love\/3015-1431\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1431\">love<\/a>. These relationships can develop into crazy and bizarre situations that the game is known for.<\/p><h2>Controversy<\/h2><p>The game initially seemed to allow for two male Miis to engage in a relationship and subsequently get married. However, this was a bug that could also hard-crash the game and corrupt the save file and was thus removed from the game in a patch not long after the game's launch. This drew heavy criticism from certain media outlets and within social networks but the reporting solely focused on the the removal of same-sex interaction without taking the full context into account.<\/p><p>After the western localization was announced, <a href=\"http:\/\/candycrushcopeland.tumblr.com\/post\/82295382857\/nintendo-explains-why-it-patched-same-sex-relationships\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Nintendo UK commented<\/a> on the matter and explained the context surrounding this controversy:<\/p><blockquote><p>Two developments occurred that led to some misunderstanding about this.<\/p><p>First, as a result of a mistake in comprehension of Japanese, some people misinterpreted Japanese reports and fan activity and thought same-sex relationships were possible.<\/p><p>This occurred because they saw Japanese fans posting game screenshots of male and female Mii characters, where female Mii characters were designed and clothed in such a way that they looked male. Since these explanations were made in Japanese by the Japanese fans who posted the images, the Japanese people do not have such a misunderstanding.<\/p><p>Second, a critical bug occurred in the original Japanese version of the game which made it impossible for the player to continue the game.<\/p><p>When Mii characters were imported from a Wii console, or the previous game in the Tomodachi Collection series on Nintendo DS (which was only released in Japan), into the Nintendo 3DS version, it could lead to scrambled Mii data within the Nintendo 3DS version.<\/p><p>This could result in different Miis being randomly assigned to existing in-game relationships, such as already married Mii, or as just one other example, giving the appearance of same-sex relations. Because this bug caused the inability for the player to save the game data and continue the game, we released a patch.<\/p><\/blockquote><h2>Reception<\/h2><p>The game is considered a surprise hit, especially in Europe where it performed extraordinarily well, selling 1 million copies <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NintendoEurope\/status\/545896415881601024\" rel=\"nofollow\">by December 2014<\/a> and breaking 2 million <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NintendoEurope\/status\/704622546185023488\" rel=\"nofollow\">by February 2016<\/a>.

Return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.","description":"<h2>Story<\/h2><p>The game begins in <a href=\"\/london\/3035-212\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-212\">London<\/a> where it is revealed that <a href=\"\/severus-snape\/3005-4985\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4985\">Snape<\/a> made the unbreakable vow with Narcissa Malfoy, <a href=\"\/draco-malfoy\/3005-6754\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6754\">Draco's<\/a> mother. Meanwhile, the wizard world is in crisis over the antics of the Death Eaters, <a href=\"\/lord-voldemort\/3005-3945\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3945\">Voldemort's<\/a> followers. Harry spends some time at the <a href=\"\/the-burrow\/3035-2386\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2386\">Burrow<\/a>, where after a broom ride he discovers his affection for <a href=\"\/ginny-weasley\/3005-5159\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5159\">Ginny Weasley<\/a>. Harry starts to think that Draco Malfoy has become a Death Eater, which leads to Harry spying on him on the train ride to <a href=\"\/hogwarts-castle\/3035-569\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-569\">Hogwarts<\/a>. Malfoy finds Harry, and paralyzes him until he is rescued by Luna Lovegood. When Harry first enters Hogwarts, he discovers that Snape has become the defence against the dark arts teacher.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Harry attends his classes, participates in the dueling club, and plays on the Gryffindor Quidditch team like any other student. His Potions book is second hand, and at one time belonged to the Half Blood Prince. The potions book is modified with different instructions, which result in better potions and the admiration of Slughorn, but the jealousy of <a href=\"\/hermione-granger\/3005-4341\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4341\">Hermione.<\/a><\/p><p>The potions book also contained the spell sectumsempra. When Harry used the spell on Draco, it injured him, guilting Harry to hide the book in the room of retirement. <a href=\"\/ron-weasley\/3005-4554\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4554\">Ron Weasley<\/a> stars to date Lavender Brown, to Hermione's distaste, which leaves Harry caught in the middle of their conflict. Harry meets with Albus Dumbledore to learn more about Voldemort's life, mostly through the use of a pensieve and collected memories. One memory is incomplete however, and Harry is tasked with trying to retrieve it from Professor Slughorn. After one unsuccessful attempt, Harry drinks his Felix Felicis, which he had earned earlier from Slughorn. Harry retrieves the memory, and he and Dumbledore learn that Voldemort has created 6 <a href=\"\/horcrux\/3015-3788\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3788\">Horcruxes<\/a>, and split his soul into 7 pieces to preserve his immortality.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Dumbledore tracks down the location of one of the Horcruxes, and he and Harry go to retrieve it. They travel to a <a href=\"\/horcrux-cave\/3035-2385\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2385\">cave<\/a>, and Dumbledore drinks a potion from a cauldron to retrieve what appears to be the Horcrux. The two return to Hogwarts, but when they were gone Malfoy had let the Death Eaters into the castle vis the room of requirement. Dumbledore is cornered and killed by Snape, fulfilling his unbreakable vow. The Death Eaters then flee, while Harry chases after them and attempts to duel Snape. Harry then learns that Snape was the Half Blood Prince. The next day, Harry opens the locket, and discovers that it is not a Horcrux. The real Horcrux was taken by a R.A.B earlier.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><h3>Xbox 360\/PS3<\/h3><p>On the current generation consoles, the game play mostly involves one of 3 minigames. There is a potion brewing game, where the player must brew a potion as quickly as possible. There is also an on-rails flying game, where the player flies through a series of rings. The third minigame is a dueling game. The player casts spells on the right stick and tries to take away all of their opponents health. There is also an open world, which serves as a connection between cutscenes and minigames. There are also collectible Hogwarts Crests hidden throughout the world which unlock extra characters in the multiplayer dueling.<\/p><p> <\/p><h3>Wii<\/h3><p>The Wii release is very similar to the Xbox\/PS3 releases, except that the right stick motions are replaced with motion controls for the spell casting.<\/p>","expected_release_day":30,"expected_release_month":6,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":2009,"guid":"3030-22766","id":22766,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1824044-box_hpotterathbp.png","image_tags":"All

they are also able to control Shaun and Mendosa at certain times in the story. 25 To Life controls like most action crime third person shooters of the time, with the joystick for movement and various buttons for actions, e.g. shooting, running and taking cover.<\/p><p>25 to Life also featured online gameplay that essentially devolved into cops vs. robbers. One group of participants would play as cops while the other group would play as criminals in gameplay scenarios that ranged from robbing a bank and getting away with the loot to raiding a criminal stronghold in a siege-like mode.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>The main character, Freeze, commits crimes with his friend Shaun, and in turn he spends his loot on his family.<\/p><p>One day Freeze's wife confronts him about his criminal activities, telling him he needs to quit as she is worried his behaviour will be a corrupting influence on their son. Freeze agrees and informs his friend Shaun of his decision, after hearing this Shaun pulls put a gun and directs it at Freeze's head and orders him to do one last job.<\/p><p>Freeze embarks on this final job where he is to take out a Columbian drug cartel, stealing their cash and drugs, but when Freeze arrives he finds the Columbians dead and a cop waiting. After fleeing Freeze loses the cops and decides to rob a bank, the cops arrive during the robbery and arrest him.<\/p><p>Freeze escapes from incarceration and decides to hunt down Shaun and exact revenge for setting him up.

battles, this game simulates the life of a black tiger who thanks to its color, has no choice but to slaughter every non-tiger it sees. This genocidal quest is made fairly easy as one and all, enemies (all non-tigers) will slowly make their way over to the black tiger in a straight line thanks to no object collision detection to speak of and slowly jab at him with claws or jaws or spears (in the case of humans). This is fine, as the black tiger is quickly demonstrated to have by far the highest armor and DPS of any life form it encounters. The black tiger is gifted with an unexplained and highly limited teleportation ability that lets him face any of eight directions without any perceivable transition time, making his movement animation very disconcerting to his enemies as well as the player. The only non-enemy the black tiger encounters is compassionately and exclusively referred to as \"The Female Tiger\", who the Black Tiger with his unexplained glowing scars, must court in order to propagate his edgelord species.<\/p><p>Originally a free game on mobile devices, Life of Black Tiger was released for download on the PS4 in January of 2017 with a price point of $9.99. After Sony published a trailer for it at the same time as, and presumably to compete with the announcement for the Nintendo Switch, it quickly incited a controversy over whether the whole thing was a huge joke on Sony's part. It has since become widely regarded as the worst game on the PS4 platform.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-57950","id":57950,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/2915847-2015223154-31316.jpg","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/2915847-2015223154-31316.jpg","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/2915847-2015223154-31316.jpg","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/2915847-2015223154-31316.jpg","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/2915847-2015223154-31316.jpg","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/2915847-2015223154-31316.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/2915847-2015223154-31316.jpg","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/2915847-2015223154-31316.jpg","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/2915847-2015223154-31316.jpg","image_tags":"All Images"},"image_tags":[],"name":"Life Of Black Tiger","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":null,"original_release_date":"2017-01-31 00:00:00","platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-96\/","id":96,"name":"iPhone","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/iphone\/3045-96\/","abbreviation":"IPHN"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-123\/","id":123,"name":"Android","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/android\/3045-123\/","abbreviation":"ANDR"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-146\/","id":146,"name":"PlayStation 4","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/playstation-4\/3045-146\/","abbreviation":"PS4"}],"site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/life-of-black-tiger\/3030-57950\/","resource_type":"game"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-44554\/","date_added":"2013-11-22 14:47:30","date_last_updated":"2015-02-15 09:50:32","deck":"Starting as an amateur footballer by training hard and making correct career choices you can gradually become a world famous professional.

Almost everything that a person can think of can either be found, bought, or created in Second Life - whether it's an avatar that looks like a cat, transformer, Master Chief lookalike - perhaps a virtual club or a roleplay area with a specific rule set. Due to the flexibility regarding what can be done in the game, abstract virtual fetishes have developed over time. The people that populate the world of Second Life (aka The Grid) do so as avatars, 3D virtual representations of themselves that can be customized as they see fit. Communication between avatars can either be conducted in a public chat, private instant messages, or group chats--all of which can either be done through the use of voice or regular text chat.<\/p><p>As far as goals go, there are none other than the ones a person sets for themselves. And thanks to the fact that everyone is different, there is a great diversity of content to be found within the game (some of it being more niche than other things).<\/p><h2>Getting Started<\/h2><p>Getting started in Second Life is as easy as signing up for a free basic account at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.secondlife.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-mce-href=\"http:\/\/www.secondlife.com\"> their website<\/a> where you pick the name of the avatar that you will use to represent yourself in-world (of which the first name is entirely of your choosing and the last name a list of choices), and a simple starting appearance. Once you have successfully completed the signup process you need to download and install the Second Life Viewer, which is the client software that allows you to connect to the service and enter the Second Life Grid. Every new avatar that joins the game gets dropped at one of the tutorial islands, where they learn the basics such as moving around, using search, the map, and teleporting.<\/p><p>With the introduction of land covenants, it became a lot easier for people with virtual land to sublet to other people, negating the necesity of getting a premium account to get a house. This spurred a large increase in Second Life players dealing in virtual real estate.<\/p><h3>Premium Accounts<\/h3><p>If one wishes, it's also possible to opt for a premium account which gives you various benefits such as being a able to buy a small (512m) plot of virtual land, get priority support, and receive a weekly stipend of in-world currency called Linden Dollars (L$) that can be used to purchase various items in the world. However, due to the ever-increasing open-source approach of Linden Lab, the ability to earn L$ through various in-world jobs, and the option of 'renting' land from other users, the average Second Life resident will find that they have no need for a premium account. And should you really have a need for something but not have the required amount of L$ to get it, you can always purchase more of the virtual currency using real money.<\/p><h3>Linden Homes<\/h3><p>As of February 17, 2010, people with a premium account can get a Linden Home. This is completely free, but it does use up the 512m of your land tier.<\/p><h2>Economy<\/h2><p>Like most other online games, Second Life, too, has its own virtual economy, which is based on the exchange of virtual currency called Linden Dollars. Unlike most other online games, however, Linden Dollars can be freely exchanged for real money. This allows residents to trade the money they earned in-world for actual cash. Due to this approach, the option exists for users to generate an actual income. Some people actually earn enough money through their Second Life bussiness that they no longer require a job in the real world. Due to the low exchange rate of the L$, however, and the constantly growing population in the game, it's becoming increasingly difficult to create unique, competitive content that will allow one to generate a viable income.<\/p><h2>Content Creation<\/h2><p>Pretty much everything you see in the game is content by Second Life residents using various in-game and third-party tools. Such content can be scripts, objects, clothing, or a combination thereof.<\/p><h3>Building<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5427\/511545-building_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511545\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.58869047619048\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5427\/511545-building_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511545\"><img alt=\"Simple example of building tools\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5427\/511545-building_001.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5427\/511545-building_001.jpg 1680w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/5427\/511545-building_001.jpg 960w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5427\/511545-building_001.jpg 480w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5427\/511545-building_001.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Simple example of building tools<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Building objects in Second Life can be achieved by using standard tools available in the game itself. Each object built consists of so called prims, which are basically the building blocks of said object, and there is a maximum amount of prims that can be used for an object you create. Depending on whether it incorporates physics or not, this limit can be higher or lower. Prims are easily created by right clicking on any land that has building enabled (land owners can choose to enable or disable building) and hitting the create button. This will \"rez\" a standard block of which you can alter various properties such as its shape, size, default action, etc. Depending on the complexity of what you're trying to create, a different number of prims need to be individually shaped and linked together to get a satisfactory end result. This means that one can create a simple wall structure consisting of a single prim, simply by resizing it, or you can create more complicated things like vehicles, attachments for avatars to wear, and what not to wear. Obviously the more complex the object you're trying the create, the more skill and time it requires.<\/p><p>Content that you create this way can also have scripts, which you can either add to the object as a whole or an individual prim of said object.<\/p><h3>Scripting<\/h3><p>Second Life uses its own scripting language called Linden Scripting Language, but it's more commonly referred to as simply LSL, and it has a syntax similar to that of a C\/Java-style language. LSL can be used to asign different behaviours to various objects, such as the ability to interact with the avatars in the game's world, sending out e-mails, or communcating with websites. Examples range from a simple script to make an object rotate around its own axis, to far more complex scripts that allows an object to fully interact with a website where content created by other users are listed for sale. Of course like all solid scripting languages, LSL can be quite a challenge to learn, so most people will resort to either buying something that alread has the desired fuction, or paying someone to make a custom script. And while there is enough material to learn LSL, a lot of it is spread out and largely unorganized, making it a daunting task to learn the language for beginners.<\/p><p>Trivia<\/p><ul><li><p>Linden Lab acquired Windward Mark's Windlight engine for use in Second Life &amp; released it under a creative Commons License, sending their promising First Person Shooter \"Alliance: The Silent War\" into the \"indefinite cancellation\" status.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><h2>Open Simulator<\/h2><p>In 2007 a group of open source developers got together and coded their own virtual world's platform, <a href=\"http:\/\/opensimulator.org\/wiki\/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-mce-href=\"http:\/\/opensimulator.org\/wiki\/Main_Page\"> Open Simulator<\/a>(or OpenSim) which is based on Second Life protocols and has a very similar look and feel. It is also possible to download content you made in Second Life to an Opensim grid to use, sell or give away. The most significant difference is that OpenSim is available to anyone to download and set up their own world free of charge other than the cost of server hosting but it can be run on a home computer and linked to one of the established grids like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.osgrid.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-mce-href=\"http:\/\/www.osgrid.org\/\"> OSgrid<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/17\/170057\/2342722-osgrid_map_logo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2342722\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.809375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/17\/170057\/2342722-osgrid_map_logo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2342722\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/17\/170057\/2342722-osgrid_map_logo.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/17\/170057\/2342722-osgrid_map_logo.png 640w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/17\/170057\/2342722-osgrid_map_logo.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/17\/170057\/2342722-osgrid_map_logo.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/original\/17\/170057\/2342722-osgrid_map_logo.png 640w, https:\/\/giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/17\/170057\/2342722-osgrid_map_logo.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>OpenSim was made possible because Linden Labs released their viewer code to the open source community when, at that time in 2007, the Lab was keen to explore shared interoperability between virtual worlds. This lead to avatars being able to grid hop or teleport between Second Life and OpenSim worlds. However, Linden Labs had a change of mind and shut down the project but the OpenSim community continued to grow and develop. The experiments with grid hopping lead to more advanced processes enabling what became known as Hypergrid which allowed avatars to continue teleporting with their full appearance and inventory. Today, Hypergrid forms an important part of the OpenSim Metaverse enabling many content makers and game builders to express their creativity and flair at a fraction of the cost of Second Life.<\/p><p>Today their are over 200 OpenSim grids both small and large. OSgrid is the biggest and the original developer's grid which is run on donations but there are many more including commercial grids with their own economies and token currencies.<\/p>","expected_release_day":23,"expected_release_month":6,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":2003,"guid":"3030-20237","id":20237,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/491906-secondlife_1.jpg","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/491906-secondlife_1.jpg","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/491906-secondlife_1.jpg","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/491906-secondlife_1.jpg","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/491906-secondlife_1.jpg","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/491906-secondlife_1.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/491906-secondlife_1.jpg","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/491906-secondlife_1.jpg","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/491906-secondlife_1.jpg","image_tags":"All
