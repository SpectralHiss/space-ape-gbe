The Xbox 360 version also includes support for the <a href=\"/kinect-support/3015-3249/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3249\">Kinect</a>, in which players can use the peripheral's <a href=\"/voice-commands/3015-295/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-295\">built-in microphone</a> to both give tactical orders to Shepard's squad and choose dialogue options by paraphrasing them.</p><p>Players can import completed game files from Mass Effect 2 (provided that Shepard survived the suicide mission), carrying with them Shepard's appearance, experience level, and many decisions made in that game (both major and minor, including decisions made in the original <a href=\"/mass-effect/3030-16909/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16909\">Mass Effect</a> if the character was previously imported from that game to Mass Effect 2). Also like the previous game, players can purchase a Dark Horse interactive comic (titled <em>Mass Effect: Genesis 2.0</em>) which details the complete backstory while allowing players to make key plot decisions from both previous games (which is then applied to the player's created character).</p><p>The game was later ported to the <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> (on November 18, 2012 as a <a href=\"/launch-titles/3015-238/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-238\">launch title</a>) by <a href=\"/straight-right/3010-8253/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8253\">Straight Right</a>. Titled <em>Mass Effect 3: Special Edition</em>, this version features optional use of the Wii U's GamePad, as the touch screen can show both a <a href=\"/minimap/3015-185/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-185\">minimap</a> and customizable <a href=\"/hotkey/3015-351/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-351\">hotkeys</a> for abilities. The GamePad can also be used for <a href=\"/off-tv-play/3015-7482/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7482\">Off-TV Play</a>. It also includes some of the game's DLC for free, including the <em>Mass Effect: Genesis 2.0</em> comic (as there is no way to play the two original games for the Wii U). </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Armor (Shepard)</h3><p>Shepard's armor is fully-customizable.</p><p>Each customizable armor sets and headpieces can be customized (only in bulk) from the Armor Customization screen by color (including both overtone and undertone), material (the shininess of the armor), color pattern (including an additional color), and light color.

Optionally, in the Options menu, players can toggle Shepard's headpiece so it does not show up during dialogue. Some pieces can be found throughout missions, but all can be found within Citadel stores.</p><ul><li><b>N7 Helmet</b> - Initially available.

Biotic users primarily have the ability to manipulate dark energy fields, which can cause direct damage and disarray to enemies.</p></li><li><p><b>Tech</b> - Focused on special abilities using the character's omni-tool. Tech users primarily have the ability to throw elemental attacks at enemies.</p></li></ul><p>Unlike the previous games in the franchise, class proficiencies do not restrict Shepard to any kind of weapon or armor. However, different classes have different weight capacity bonuses (high-Combat classes can carry heavier weapons with less burden on the cooldown timers of their active powers).</p><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>Soldier</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2165221-class_soldier.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2165221\" data-ratio=\"1.3487903225806\" data-width=\"496\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 496px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2165221-class_soldier.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2165221\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2165221-class_soldier.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2165221-class_soldier.png 496w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2165221-class_soldier.png 474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\"></a></figure><p>Pure combat specialists who, through intense weapons training, can focus directly on their targets for lethal accuracy.

Mass Effect 3 combines the large number of weapons, upgradable weapon statistics, and <a href=\"/weapon-modification/3015-2624/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2624\">weapon modifications</a> from the original Mass Effect with the \"thermal cooling\" <a href=\"/ammo/3055-533/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-533\">ammunition</a> system of Mass Effect 2. Weapons are split up into the following categories: <a href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-413\">Assault Rifles</a>, <a href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\">Sniper Rifles</a>, <a href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">Heavy Pistols</a>, <a href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\">Shotguns</a>, and <a href=\"/submachine-gun/3055-766/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-766\">Submachine Guns</a>.</p><p>In the predecessor games, the player's class determines what guns they are able to use. While this still holds true to single-player squadmates, Commander Shepard (as well as multiplayer characters) can hold, at most, one of each category of weapon (no matter which class or experience level he/she is). However, weapons now have a Weight attribute. Players carrying a heavy payload of weapons have a penalty to the recharge time of the player's active powers (up to double the standard recharge time). Conversely, players carrying a light weapon load have a recharge time bonus to their active powers (up to half the standard recharge time).</p><p>In single-player, weapons (other than the starting weapons) and weapon modifications must be bought or collected throughout the game. In multiplayer, however, they can only be found in Reinforcement Packs (in which certain weapons and mods can only be found in more expensive packs).</p><p>NOTE: In the list of weapons, Common/Uncommon/Rare/Ultra-Rare designate each weapon's multiplayer rarities.</p><h3>Sniper Rifles</h3><ul><li><b>M-92 Mantis</b> (Common) - Starting weapon in both single-player and multiplayer.

Instead, they can be picked up in certain single-player missions and are thrown away after either switching to another weapon (in which it can be picked up again later) or using up all of its ammo. Despite this, these weapons are extremely powerful (and sometimes necessary).</p><ul><li><b>Reaper Blackstar</b> - Found during Priority: Palaven, Leviathan DLC and Tuchanka: Turian Platoon.</li><li><b>M-451 Firestorm</b> - <a href=\"/flamethrower/3055-45/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-45\">Flamethrower</a> found during the mission Attican Traverse: Krogan Team.

As an elite squad of N7 operatives, players infiltrate key positions in the galaxy and hold out against waves of either <a href=\"/cerberus/3015-3233/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3233\">Cerberus</a>, <a href=\"/geth/3015-1394/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1394\">Geth</a>, <a href=\"/the-reapers/3015-742/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-742\">Reaper</a>, or <a href=\"/the-collectors/3015-4352/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4352\">Collector</a> (as of October 9, 2012) forces. Along the way, they must perform certain objectives, such as eliminating key enemy personnel and hacking enemy equipment.</p><p>Players earn currency which allows them to buy special \"Reinforcement Packs\", containing special cards that unlock character slots, armor customization options, equipment, item slots, weapons, and weapon modifications. By leveling up their character classes, as well as obtaining high-level equipment, squads have a better chance of finishing high-difficulty missions.</p><p>All versions require an <a href=\"/origin/3015-7040/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7040\">Origin</a> account to access this mode. Prior to May 30, 2013, the 360 and PS3 versions of the mode required the activation of an <a href=\"/new-purchase-incentives/3015-5244/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5244\">\"online pass\"</a> DLC (included in new copies of the game or sold for $10 on official storefronts).</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>The goal in each multiplayer mission is to team up with up to three allies and exterminate ten <a href=\"/horde/3015-3021/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\">waves</a> of enemies (which gradually get more difficult with the addition of tougher enemies) while achieving special objectives. These objectives activate every third, sixth, and tenth wave and consist of one of the following (at random):</p><ul><li><p>Within five minutes, players must hack four randomly-placed beacons in a particular order. They do this by directly interacting with each device (a slow process that makes the hacker defenseless) until the hacker's progress meter fills up completely. If the hack process is stopped abruptly, the progress meter is reset. While multiple players can hack the same device at the same time, it does not speed up the process in any way. (Though it can be used to counter <a href=\"/griefing/3015-87/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-87\">griefing</a>, as people can pretend to hack the device only to stop at the last second)</p></li><li><p>Within five minutes, players must upload data from a randomly-placed terminal by activating it and then standing near it for a certain amount of time. When more players stand near the terminal, the upload process becomes faster.</p></li><li><p>Within a short amount of time, players must eliminate five specific enemies in a particular order. Successfully eliminating the enemy adds time to the countdown timer.</p></li><li><p>Within a short amount of time, players must retrieve two high priority packages and transport them to a designated extraction zone. Players carrying the packages cannot sprint, evade, or use certain powers. Added in the Rebellion Pack DLC.</p></li><li><p>Within a short amount of time, players must activate and escort a Combat Drone to a designated extraction zone. When more players stand near the drone, its speed increases. The drone occasionally replenishes nearby player shields and attacks nearby enemies with missiles or electric shocks. Added in the Earth DLC.</p></li></ul><p>If the team fails the objective by letting the countdown timer hit zero, the mission fails and the game is over immediately. Succeeding each objective grants both bonus experience and Credits. After the tenth wave, the team have two minutes to retreat to the evacuation zone and defend their position against never-ending swarms of enemies.</p><h3>Classes</h3><p>Players can create one customizable character for each character slot (based on the classes below). From the start, players are limited to the two human slots for all classes, each with minimal armor customization. Players can unlock new character slots (per race per class) and cosmetic customization options (for each character slot) by unlocking special character cards inside Reinforcement Packs (determined by rarity). Unlocking character cards also grant bonus experience points for the entire class.</p><p>Along with a unique assortment of active powers, each race also has their own amount of base health and base shield strength, evasion maneuver (with some races unable to evade at all), class restrictions, and melee attacks. Some races have their own unique ability (such as Rage for krogans, which gives them into a temporary buff after consecutive melee kills).</p><h4>Adept</h4><ul><li><b><a href=\"/human/3015-810/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">Human</a> Adept</b> (Common) - Active Powers: Singularity, Warp, Shockwave.</li><li><b><a href=\"/drell/3015-4350/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4350\">Drell</a><b> Adept</b></b> (Uncommon) - Active Powers: Reave, Pull, Cluster Grenade.</li><li><b><a href=\"/asari/3015-1582/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1582\">Asari</a><b> Adept</b></b> (Rare) - Active Powers: Statis, Warp, Throw.</li><li><b>Asari Justicar</b> (Rare) - Added in the Resurgence Pack DLC.

After reaching level 20 with a single class, players can promote that class, resetting the level back down to 1 while granting bonuses for the Galaxy At War system and the N7 ranking. (Unlocked races and armor customization options are still kept)</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>In multiplayer mode, equipment are single-use items found inside most Reinforcement Packs that are split into three categories:</p><ul><li><p><b>Bonuses</b> - Special single-use armor and weapon modifications that can be assigned to the individual player prior to starting the match. Players can assign one bonus at a time in each category: Ammo (which grants one of the five ammo type powers to all of the player's weapons), Weapon (which grants a damage bonus for one weapon type), and Armor (which grants a bonus to either shield, movement speed, power damage, or power recharge speed). Each bonus comes in three levels of strength (increasing their effectiveness), with level 1 bonuses appearing in Common-oriented booster packs and level 3 bonuses appearing in Rare-oriented booster packs. Once the player downloads the Resurgence Pack DLC, he/she can find a new Weapon Bonus (which grants a damage bonus for melee attacks) and new Armor Bonuses (which grants a bonus to either power duration, shield recharge speed, weapon stability, or headshot damage).</p></li><li><p><b>Supplies</b> - Special in-game inventory items that can be activated in-game to quell desperate situations. Consists of the Cobra Missile Launcher (in which the player switches to a powerful one-shot missile launcher that can destroy all enemies in a large radius), Thermal Clip Pack (automatically refilling the player's thermal clips and grenade supply), Ops Survival Pack (automatically refilling the player's health and shields), and Medi-Gel (automatically reviving the player if he/she is incapacitated). Players can carry up to two (more if he/she finds a Supply Upgrade) of each supply.</p></li><li><p><b>Supply Upgrades</b> - Rare cards that automatically adds one to the capacity of a random supply, allowing the player to use more of that supply in one match.</p></li></ul><p>In addition, players can rarely find a \"Reset Powers\" card which they can use to reset the power distribution of one character slot (retaining all of the class's experience points). Players can carry a maximum of three \"Reset Powers\" options at one time.</p><h3>Reinforcement Packs</h3><p>Players earn currency (known as Credits) in-game (by successfully completing special objectives) which allows them to buy special Reinforcement Packs, containing special cards that unlock character slots, equipment, item slots, weapons, and weapon modifications. For most packs, players can also <a href=\"/microtransaction/3015-199/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-199\">use real currency instead</a>.</p><p>Earning character cards for character slots players have already unlocked instead grants additional armor customization options (as well as additional experience points). Earning weapon cards for weapons players have already unlocked instead upgrades the weapon's level. Earning weapon modification cards for weapon modifications players have already unlocked instead upgrades the weapon modification's level.</p><ul><li><b>Recruit Pack</b> (5,000 Credits) - Five random cards. Small chance for one Uncommon.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Veteran Pack</b> (20,000 Credits / $0.99 USD) - Five random cards. Guarantee for one Uncommon or better.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Jumbo Equipment Pack</strong> (33,000 Credits / $1.49 USD) - Ten random equipment cards.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Spectre Pack</b> (60,000 Credits / $1.99 USD) - Five random cards. Guarantee for one Rare or better.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Premium Spectre Pack</strong> (99,000 Credits / $2.99 USD) - Five random cards. Guarantee for two Rares or better. Increased chance for Ultra-Rares.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Arsenal Pack</strong> (99,000 Credits / $2.99 USD) - Five random cards. Guarantee for two Rares or better. Increased chance for weapon cards.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Reserves Pack</strong> (99,000 Credits / $2.99 USD) - Five random cards. Guarantee for two Rares or better. Increased chance for character cards.</li></ul><h3>Weekend Operations</h3><p>Between March 16, 2012 and March 10, 2013, Bioware did weekly community events known as \"N7 Bounty Weekends\". For every weekend, players participates in challenges (such as dealing a certain amount of damage with a weapon) to earn a bonus \"Commendation Pack\" (earning them a special N7 weapon).</p><p>Prior to October 21, 2012, these events had a community requirement (such as killing one million of a certain enemy, overall) that must be fulfilled to earn a \"Victory Pack\". Three of these events resulted in failure, causing a penalty in their following weekend event (such as Operation BROADSIDE, which extended the extraction time by 30 seconds).</p><h2>Cross-Promotions</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123979\" data-ratio=\"1.279296875\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123979\"><img alt=\"Crossover promotional image with Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8960/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/8960/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg 1024w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8960/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg 750w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8960/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg 500w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Crossover promotional image with Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8960/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/8960/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg 1024w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8960/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg 750w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8960/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Crossover promotional image with Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.</figcaption></figure><p>To promote both Mass Effect 3 and <a href=\"../../kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning/61-30330/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a>, another action RPG published by <a href=\"../../electronic-arts/65-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Electronic Arts</a>, both games have exclusive content that can be unlocked by playing the demo of the other game:</p><ul><li><b>Reckoner Knight Armor</b> - Special non-customizable armor (which boosts helath, shields, weapon damage, and melee damage) for Shepard in Mass Effect 3 that can be unlocked by linking to an <a href=\"/origin/3015-7040/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7040\">Origin</a> account that has played the Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning demo.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Chakram Launcher -</strong> A chargeable semi-automatic rifle for Mass Effect 3 (single-player campaign only) that can be unlocked by linking to an Origin account that has watched the end video, shown at the end of the Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning demo, in its entirety.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Omniblade Daggers -</strong> Daggers resembling the omni-tool blades for Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning that can be unlocked by linking to an Origin account that has played the Mass Effect 3 demo.</li></ul><p>To promote both Mass Effect 3 and <a href=\"/battlefield-3/3030-27006/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27006\">Battlefield 3</a>, a modern military first-person shooter published by Electronic Arts, both games have exclusive content cross-promoting each-other:</p><ul><li><b>Battlefield 3 Soldier</b> - A multiplayer character slot for the Soldier class featuring a non-customizable armor based on the \"Soldier of Fire\" promotional image for Battlefield 3 that can be unlocked in Mass Effect 3 by linking to an Origin account that is tied to a Battlefield 3 Online Pass.

The <a href=\"../../asari/92-1582/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asari</a> councilor informs Shepard that information regarding the Catalyst is contained in a <a href=\"../../protheans/92-1751/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prothean</a> artifact located on Thessia. The last mission to gain council aid involves the Asari homeworld of Thessia. While Shepard does not manage to help save Thessia from Reaper attacks, he finds that the Crucible needs a Catalyst in order to successfully destroy the Reapers. Just before acquiring the information, Kai Leng and Cerberus attack and steal the information from Shepard. Admiral Hackett and Shepard launch an attack on the Cerberus and the Illusive Man's headquarters, and find that the Catalyst was in front of them all along - The Citadel.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/2141067-at02_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2141067\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/2141067-at02_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2141067\"><img alt=\"Cerberus is at it again.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/2141067-at02_001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5911/2141067-at02_001.jpg 1920w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5911/2141067-at02_001.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/2141067-at02_001.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cerberus is at it again.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/2141067-at02_001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5911/2141067-at02_001.jpg 1920w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_super/0/5911/2141067-at02_001.jpg 960w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/2141067-at02_001.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cerberus is at it again.</figcaption></figure><p>Unforunately, the Reapers found out that knowledge of the Catalyst was discovered, and the Citadel was closed and moved beside Earth in order to prevent the Crucible from being used. It's at this point that Shepard combines all united forces and coordinates an attack to retake the Citadel and combine it with the Crucible to destroy the Reapers. Due to the closure of the Citadel, the allied forces find that they must reopen it by using a beam being ejected to earth from the Citadel.</p><p>At this point, Shepard and Hammer team make a final assault toward the beam, but the majority of the squad is wiped out when Harbinger intervenes and Shepard is hit by a blast. Staggering, Shepard manages to reach the beam, and finds that Anderson had done so as well. When they find a control panel, they are interrupted by the Illusive Man who's still bent on finding ways to control the Reapers and stop Shepard from destroying them. Eventually, the Illusive Man is defeated, but Anderson dies and Shepard loses consciousness just before being informed that the Crucible did not fire.</p><p>Shepard awakens and is greeted by an artificial intelligence who refers to himself as the Catalyst. The Catalyst informs Shepard that he is the entity controlling the Reapers, and that their purpose is to preserve organic life by exterminating the most advanced forms of life at the end of every cycle. He explains that it is necessary as organic life is always opposed by the synthetic life that they create and are doomed to be destroyed by their own creations.</p><p>The Catalyst also explains that life is not wasted, but merely harvested and used to create more reapers and less capable, primitive organic lifeforms are spared for the start of the new cycle. The Catalyst then admits that since Shepard proved that the cycle could not continue as it has by building the Crucible, a new plan has to be made. He offers Shepard one of three choices: Destroy the Reapers as well as all Synthetic life, Control the Reapers, or create a Synergy between organics and synthetics. The synergy would create a new form of life, new DNA, that is based on Shepard's current form - being both synthetic and organic. Each choice is color-coded with the colors: red, blue and green (respectively).</p><p>Regardless of choice, the mass relays are all destroyed, the Reapers leave Earth, and the Normandy crash-lands on an alien planet. Depending on Effective Military Strength (EMS), Earth can be destroyed, heavily damaged, or saved and some of the Normandy crew can be seen exiting the Normandy after it crash lands. If the 'destroy' ending is chosen, and the EMS is high enough, it's revealed that Shepard survived.</p><p>A post-credits sequence shows a man (stargazer) and a child looking up at the stars. The child asks if the story was really true, and the man confirms it but tells the child that some of the details may have been lost in time. He also states that it all happened a long time ago. The child inquires about going and seeing the stars for himself, and the man describes the galaxy as a billion stars, containing many worlds, and are all inhabited by different races and cultures. The child then asks the man to tell him another story about 'the Shepard'.</p><h2>DLC Packs</h2><h3>From Ashes</h3><p>At Eden Prime, Shepard, Liara and another squadmate found the last Prothean. Javik is a new squadmate when buying this dlc. It is avalible through the Collector's Edition or online.</p><h3>Extended Cut</h3><p>The ending of Mass Effect 3 was harshly received by a vocal segment of the game's fanbase. Common complaints regarding the ending reference a sudden, sharp decline in the level of narrative coherence, the introduction of the Catalyst as a character in the hologram form of the little boy whose death haunts Shepard over the course of the game, and an almost complete lack of player agency. The ending also does not take into account many of the choices that players made over the course of the trilogy; rather, it forces the player to choose between one of three possible solutions to the Reaper threat (Destroy, Control, Synthesis), the availability of which are dependent on the player's Galactic Readiness rating.</p><p>Bioware addressed the criticism by announcing that they would produce a downloadable update entitled \"Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut.\" Released on June 26, 2012, the free update adds material to all three endings in order to clarify at least some of the confusion and ambiguity. The player is also given new dialogue options during the meeting with the Catalyst to learn more about its motivations and history. The Extended Cut also offers a new, fourth ending, in which, at the player's choice, Commander Shepard can reject the Catalyst and the use of the Crucible. There is otherwise no new playable content included in the update, as the adjustments to the endings are all cinematic in nature.</p><h3>Leviathan</h3><p>Shepard was greeted by Dr. Garret Bryson to find legends and rumors about the Reapers. Shepard was told that a <a href=\"/leviathans/3015-7685/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7685\">Reaper-killer</a> is on the loose. Shepard found the trackings of the Leviathan on 2181 Desponia. Shepard talked with the Leviathan and learned that the Reapers were copies of the Leviathans. The Leviathans agreed to help Shepard but only for their race. Released in August 28, 2012.</p><h3>Omega</h3><p>At the Citadel, Aria was saying that Omega was stolen by Oleg Petrovsky. Shepard goes to Omega and met a Talon named Nyreen Kandros. Released in November 2012.</p><h4>Citadel</h4><p>At the Citadel, Shepard needed a long deserved break with old squadmates. It was interupted that a gang led by a Shepard clone wanted the real Shepard dead. Released in March 5, 2013.</p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation</h2><p>The installation greatly decreases loading times, and requires a total of 14.6 GB between two discs.</p><p>Disc one requires 7.6 GB, and disc two requires 7.0 GB.
